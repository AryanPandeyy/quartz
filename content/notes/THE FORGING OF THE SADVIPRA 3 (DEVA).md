How do we define a Tantric as a Deva or divine personality – what are the external criteria. Shrii Sarkar explains:

> When ideology is totally reflected in a personality, that very personality is worshipped as a divine personality, a god. Ordinary people follow His instructions; they want to be guided by His will, because they experience bliss by moving in this way.
> 
> – Discourse 5, Namah Shiváya Shántáya

Another criteria is that one has transcended the ripus and pashas.

> One who has overcome fear, who has gone beyond fear, is called a divyácárii. And the divyácárii who successfully defeats the ripus and the páshas and, rising above petty selfishness, identifies himself or herself with the collective interest, becomes one with ParamaPuruśa. This gradual movement towards the supreme goal is the path of Tantra. It is a safe path where there is no scope for fear. And the naturalness of human life is not impaired under any circumstances.  
> The Tantric sádhaná introduced by Sadáshiva was the first sádhaná to be given in this world. Tantra sádhaná is the only sádhaná. Without sádhaná there is no Tantra and without Tantra there is no sádhaná.

Another way is that one becomes like one’s Parameśt́in Guru (Lord Shiva, Lord Krsna or Lord Anandamurti).

> _Kramena devatá bhavet_. One becomes God in due course. That is, one attains godhood. Rising step by step from viira bháva (heroic stance), one becomes a veritable god and reaches divya bháva. We call such a person whose conduct becomes ever noble, a godly person or a Shiva-like person. Such a person proceeds far along the path of evolution and one day merges in Parama Puruśa, and becomes Parama Puruśa Himself. These are the different stages of spiritual practice.

Still another way to define someone as a divine personality is their character. As Shrii Sarkar explains:

> _Sarve ca pashavah santi talavad bhútale naráh;  
> Teśáḿ jiṋána prakásháya viirabhávah prakáshitah.  
> Viirabhávaḿ sadá prápya krameńa devatá bhavet._ –Rudrayámala Tantra  
> [In the beginning everyone is a pashu, an animal. But when spiritual thirst develops, these people become viira, heroic. And when they are firmly established in viirabháva, they become devatás.]…  
> And that man is no longer known as viira. He is a deva, or devatá. Krameńa devatá bhavet. “He becomes devatá, he becomes deva in human structure, deva in human framework.” That stage is divyabháva. Then that person’s goal, his object of adoration, becomes “Mahádeva”, not Viireshvara but Mahádeva.  
> In the first phase the Lord was Pashupati, in the second phase Viireshvara, and in the final phase Mahádeva. So the same Lord, according to one’s own psycho-spiritual stratum, is to be addressed sometimes as Pashupati, sometimes as Viireshvara, and sometimes as Mahádeva. Now, I have said that a person has three types of expression: One expression is thinking, the thinking faculty, and the second one is speaking… In the first the function is within the nerve cells, and in the second, the function is – where? With the lips. And the third action is action with the physical body, corporal action.  
> And in the final stage, that is, when one attains the stage of devatá, then what one thinks, one says; and what one says, one does. There is no difference amongst thinking, saying, and doing. And that is the best stag
