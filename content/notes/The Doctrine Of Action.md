title: The Doctrine Of Action
---
What about Párthasárathi Krśńa? He is giving humanity the inspiration to work. He has supplied the desire to do karma. What has He said? He has said that you have got hands and feet, you have got a body – use them. Go on doing your duty. Your body is an excellent machine, use it efficiently. If you do not utilize it properly then you will be doing something unworthy. Do your job. Do your duty.

In doing their duty, sometimes people succeed and sometimes they do not. If you do not succeed, never get frustrated. You must remember:

**==Karmańyevádhikáraste má phaleśu kadácana;  
Má karmaphalaheturbhúmá te sauṋgo’stvakarmańi.==**

(You have the right to action but not to the fruits of the action. You must not do actions that will bind you, but you must not be averse to action, either.)

“While doing your duty, you need only attend to your work properly. You need not bother about or wait for the result. You have only the right, the duty, to attend to your job, for the result is not in your hands. You have your body and you have your work to do. Use your body and do your job. If you show negligence in the work entrusted to you by worrying about the result, the work will not be done properly. Hence do your duty, for that is your birthright.” This is karmaváda (the doctrine of action) to the extreme – karmaváda par excellence.
