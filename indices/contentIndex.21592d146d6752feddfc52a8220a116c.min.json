It is named after Ralph Merkle, who first proposed the concept in 1979. Merkle trees are primarily used for efficient and secure verification of data integrity in various applications, including blockchain technology.\n\nThe structure of a Merkle tree is based on the concept of hashing, which is a process that takes an input and produces a fixed-size output, known as a hash value or digest. The Merkle tree recursively applies hash functions to the data elements until a single root hash value is obtained, which represents the entire dataset. The structure of a Merkle tree can be explained as follows:\n\n1. Leaf Nodes:\nThe Merkle tree starts with the leaf nodes at the bottom level. Each leaf node represents a data element or a block of data. The data elements are hashed individually to produce their respective hash values, which serve as the leaf nodes of the tree.\n\n2. Intermediate Nodes:\nMoving up the tree, intermediate nodes are created by hashing pairs of leaf nodes together. Each intermediate node represents the hash value of its child nodes. The hashing algorithm used is typically a cryptographic hash function like SHA-256.\n\n3. Root Node:\nAt the top level of the tree, a single root node is formed by hashing the hash values of the two child nodes. This root node serves as the ultimate hash value that represents the entire dataset or collection of data elements.\n\nThe structure of a Merkle tree allows for efficient and secure verification of data integrity. By comparing the hash values of different parts of the tree, it is possible to determine if any data element or block has been tampered with or modified. The verification process involves providing a set of hash values (such as a path from a leaf node to the root node) and comparing them with the corresponding hash values in the Merkle tree. If all the hash values match, the data integrity is validated.\n\nMerkle trees have several advantages, including efficient storage and retrieval of large datasets, quick verification of data integrity, and the ability to handle incremental updates without having to recalculate the entire tree. These properties make Merkle trees a fundamental component in many applications, particularly in blockchain technology for ensuring the integrity of transactions and data stored in blocks.\n\n## State and Explain different components in blockchain\nBlockchain technology consists of various components that work together to enable its decentralized and secure nature. The key components of a blockchain are:\n\n1. Distributed Ledger: The distributed ledger is at the core of blockchain technology. It is a decentralized and immutable record of all transactions or data stored on the blockchain. The ledger is distributed across multiple nodes in the network, and each node maintains a copy of the entire blockchain. This distributed nature ensures transparency, resilience, and eliminates the need for a central authority.\n\n2. Blocks: Blocks are containers that hold a collection of transactions or data. Each block in the blockchain contains a reference to the previous block, forming a chain of blocks. It ensures the chronological order and integrity of the data. Blocks also typically include a timestamp, a nonce (a random number), and a hash value.\n\n3. Cryptographic Hash Function: A cryptographic hash function is used to generate a unique fixed-size string of characters, known as a hash value or digest, for each block and transaction. The hash function takes the input data and produces a hash value that is unique to that specific input. It ensures the integrity and security of the data by making it practically impossible to modify the data without changing the hash value.\n\n4. Consensus Mechanism: Consensus mechanisms are algorithms or protocols that ensure agreement among nodes in the network on the validity of transactions and the order in which they are added to the blockchain. Consensus mechanisms enable decentralized decision-making and prevent double-spending or fraud. Examples of consensus mechanisms include Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), and Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT).\n\n5. Peer-to-Peer Network: Blockchain operates on a peer-to-peer (P2P) network, where participants (nodes) in the network communicate and interact directly with each other without the need for intermediaries. Each node maintains a copy of the blockchain and participates in transaction validation and consensus. The P2P network ensures decentralization, fault tolerance, and the resilience of the blockchain system.\n\n6. Smart Contracts: Smart contracts are self-executing contracts with predefined rules and conditions written in code. They are stored on the blockchain and automatically execute when the specified conditions are met. Smart contracts enable the automation of transactions and the execution of complex agreements without the need for intermediaries. They enhance the efficiency, transparency, and security of transactions on the blockchain.\n\n7. Cryptography: Cryptography plays a crucial role in blockchain technology. It ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and security of data and transactions. Public-key cryptography is used to create digital signatures that verify the authenticity of transactions and enable secure communication between participants. Cryptography also enables encryption and decryption of data stored on the blockchain.\n\nThese components work together to create a decentralized, transparent, and secure system that allows for the storage, verification, and transfer of digital assets or information. The combination of distributed ledger, cryptographic techniques, consensus mechanisms, and smart contracts forms the foundation of blockchain technology and its various applications, such as cryptocurrencies, supply chain management, decentralized finance (DeFi), and more.\n\n## Explain the structure of a block header with a list of transactions with a suitable diagram.\nCertainly! The structure of a block header in a blockchain typically consists of various fields that contain important information about the block. Additionally, a block contains a list of transactions that are included in that particular block. Here's a description of the block header structure along with a diagram:\n\n```\nBlock Header Structure:\n-----------------------\n| Version | Previous Block Hash | Merkle Root | Timestamp | Nonce |\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n```\n\n1. Version: This field indicates the version of the blockchain protocol or software being used.\n\n2. Previous Block Hash: This field contains the hash value of the previous block in the blockchain. It ensures the chronological order and integrity of the blockchain.\n\n3. Merkle Root: The Merkle root is the hash value of the Merkle tree that includes all the transactions in the block. It serves as a summary of all the transactions, providing a single hash value that represents the entire set of transactions in the block.\n\n4. Timestamp: The timestamp field indicates the time when the block was created or mined. It helps maintain the chronological order of blocks in the blockchain.\n\n5. Nonce: The nonce (number used once) is a random value that is adjusted during the mining process. Miners repeatedly change the nonce until they find a value that, when combined with other block data, produces a hash value that meets the difficulty target set by the blockchain network. The nonce is used to create proof of work and ensure the security of the blockchain.\n\nDiagram:\n```\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|                                          Block Header                                                |\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n| Version (4 bytes) | Previous Block Hash (32 bytes) | Merkle Root (32 bytes) | Timestamp (4 bytes) | Nonce (4 bytes) |\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n|                                                                                                      |\n|                                         List of Transactions                                        |\n|                                                                                                      |\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n```\n\nIn the diagram, the block header is depicted at the top, followed by the list of transactions that are included in the block. The block header consists of fields such as version, previous block hash, Merkle root, timestamp, and nonce. Each field has a specific size, indicated in bytes.\n\nThe list of transactions below the block header represents the actual data included in the block. It can contain multiple transactions, each with its own set of inputs, outputs, and other transaction details.\n\nTogether, the block header and the list of transactions form a complete block in the blockchain. The block header contains the essential information about the block, while the list of transactions represents the actual data being stored and validated within that block.\n\nIt's important to note that the diagram and structure provided here are generalized and can vary depending on the specific blockchain implementation and protocol being used.\n\n## Explain BlockChain Layers\nBlockchain technology can be divided into different layers, each serving a specific purpose and contributing to the overall functionality of the blockchain system. The layers typically found in a blockchain architecture are as follows:\n\n1. Application Layer:\nThe application layer is the topmost layer and represents the user-facing aspect of the blockchain. It includes various applications, interfaces, and protocols that interact with the blockchain network. This layer encompasses decentralized applications (DApps), smart contracts, wallets, and user interfaces that allow users to interact with the blockchain system. The application layer enables users to perform transactions, access data, and execute specific operations on the blockchain.\n\n2. Consensus Layer:\nThe consensus layer is responsible for maintaining agreement and consistency among the nodes in the blockchain network. It ensures that all participants have the same view of the blockchain and agree on the validity and order of transactions. Different consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Work (PoW), Proof of Stake (PoS), or Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT), are implemented in this layer to achieve consensus. Consensus algorithms prevent double-spending, provide security, and maintain the integrity of the blockchain.\n\n3. Network Layer:\nThe network layer handles the communication between nodes in the blockchain network. It establishes the peer-to-peer (P2P) connections and enables nodes to exchange information, propagate transactions, and share blocks. The network layer uses various protocols and algorithms to ensure secure and efficient communication among nodes. It also manages the discovery and connection of nodes to maintain a decentralized network.\n\n4. Data Layer:\nThe data layer is responsible for storing the actual blockchain data, including blocks, transactions, and other associated information. It uses distributed ledger technology (DLT) to store and manage data across multiple nodes in the network. The data layer ensures the immutability, integrity, and transparency of the blockchain by storing data in a tamper-evident and decentralized manner. Different types of data structures, such as Merkle trees or hash-linked lists, may be employed to organize and store the data.\n\n5. Cryptography Layer:\nThe cryptography layer is fundamental to blockchain technology. It provides cryptographic techniques to secure transactions, data privacy, digital signatures, and verification processes. Public-key cryptography is widely used to ensure the authenticity and integrity of transactions. It enables secure communication between participants, protects sensitive information, and establishes trust within the blockchain system.\n\nThese layers work together to create a comprehensive blockchain architecture. Each layer has its own set of protocols, algorithms, and functionalities, contributing to the decentralized, secure, and transparent nature of blockchain technology. It's important to note that the specific layers and their functionalities may vary depending on the blockchain implementation and the specific requirements of the blockchain network.\n\n## What is distributed ledger? state several benefits of distributed ledger technology\nA distributed ledger is a type of database that is shared and synchronized across multiple nodes or computers in a network. It allows participants in the network to maintain a consistent and up-to-date record of transactions or data without the need for a central authority. Distributed ledger technology (DLT) forms the basis of blockchain systems and offers several benefits:\n\n1. Decentralization: Distributed ledgers are inherently decentralized as they are shared among multiple participants or nodes. There is no central authority controlling the ledger, which enhances transparency, resilience, and removes the need for intermediaries.\n\n2. Immutable and Tamper-Resistant: Once a transaction or data is recorded on a distributed ledger, it becomes virtually impossible to alter or tamper with it. The distributed nature of the ledger ensures that any changes require consensus among the network participants, making it highly secure and resistant to fraud or unauthorized modifications.\n\n3. Transparency: Distributed ledgers promote transparency as all participants have access to the same information. Every transaction or data entry is recorded and visible to the network, fostering trust and accountability. This transparency also aids in auditing and compliance purposes.\n\n4. Security: Distributed ledger technology utilizes cryptographic techniques to secure transactions and data. Transactions are verified and cryptographically linked, ensuring the integrity of the ledger. Additionally, consensus mechanisms employed in DLTs provide security against attacks and unauthorized access.\n\n5. Efficiency and Cost Reduction: Distributed ledgers eliminate the need for intermediaries or central authorities, reducing costs and improving efficiency. Transactions can be processed directly between participants, streamlining processes and reducing time delays. Smart contracts, often built on DLTs, automate and execute agreements, further enhancing efficiency.\n\n6. Trust and Authenticity: Distributed ledgers enhance trust and authenticity by providing a transparent and immutable record of transactions. Participants can verify the integrity and provenance of data without relying on trust in a single authority. This is particularly useful in applications like supply chain management or tracking the origin of assets.\n\n7. Enhanced Collaboration: Distributed ledgers facilitate collaboration and coordination among multiple parties. Participants can share and update a common ledger in real-time, eliminating the need for reconciliations or manual coordination. This enables new business models and opens opportunities for partnerships.\n\n8. Resilience and Fault Tolerance: Distributed ledgers are resilient to failures or attacks due to their decentralized nature. If one node or computer fails, the ledger remains accessible and operational through other participating nodes. This fault tolerance ensures continuous operation and availability of data.\n\nThese benefits make distributed ledger technology valuable across various industries and applications, including finance, supply chain management, healthcare, voting systems, and more. By leveraging the advantages of distributed ledgers, organizations can achieve greater transparency, security, efficiency, and trust in their operations.\n\n## Explain different types of blockchain\nThere are different types of blockchain, each with its own characteristics and use cases. The main types of blockchain include:\n\n1. Public Blockchain:\nPublic blockchains are open and permissionless networks where anyone can participate as a node, validate transactions, and contribute to the consensus process. These blockchains are decentralized and offer high levels of transparency and security. Examples of public blockchains include Bitcoin and Ethereum. Public blockchains are commonly used for cryptocurrencies, decentralized applications (DApps), and open financial systems.\n\n2. Private Blockchain:\nPrivate blockchains, also known as permissioned blockchains, are restricted to a specific group of participants. Access to the blockchain is controlled, and only authorized entities or nodes can participate in the consensus process. Private blockchains are typically used by organizations, consortia, or government entities for internal purposes. They offer greater privacy and scalability compared to public blockchains. Examples of private blockchains include Hyperledger Fabric and R3 Corda.\n\n3. Consortium Blockchain:\nConsortium blockchains are a hybrid form that combines elements of both public and private blockchains. They are controlled by a consortium or a group of organizations rather than a single entity. Consortium blockchains allow multiple organizations to participate in the consensus process, validate transactions, and maintain the blockchain. They offer a balance between privacy and decentralization and are often used for industry-specific use cases where multiple organizations need to collaborate and share data.\n\n4. Hybrid Blockchain:\nHybrid blockchains combine the features of public and private blockchains. They allow for both public participation and private control over certain aspects. Hybrid blockchains are useful in scenarios where some data or transactions need to be publicly accessible, while others require restricted access or confidentiality. These blockchains can be leveraged for applications that require a blend of transparency and privacy, such as supply chain management or identity verification.\n\n5. Federated Blockchain:\nFederated blockchains are similar to consortium blockchains but differ in their consensus mechanism. In federated blockchains, a limited number of pre-selected nodes or organizations are responsible for validating transactions and maintaining the blockchain. This approach offers scalability and efficiency benefits compared to fully decentralized blockchains. Federated blockchains are suitable for use cases where trust among participating entities already exists and a certain level of centralization is acceptable.\n\n6. Sidechains:\nSidechains are separate blockchains that run in parallel to the main blockchain network. They enable the execution of specific applications or use cases with different rules and features than the main blockchain. Sidechains are often used to address scalability issues or to experiment with new functionalities without affecting the main blockchain's stability. They facilitate interoperability between different blockchain networks.\n\nIt's important to note that these categories are not mutually exclusive, and variations or combinations of different blockchain types can exist. The choice of blockchain type depends on the specific requirements, trust model, scalability needs, and desired level of decentralization for a particular use case or application.\n\n# Module 2\n## Difference between HOT wallets and COLD wallets.\nHOT wallets and COLD wallets are two different types of cryptocurrency wallets used for storing and managing digital assets. The primary difference between the two lies in their level of connectivity to the internet and the security measures they employ. Here's an explanation of HOT wallets and COLD wallets:\n\n1. HOT Wallets:\nHOT wallets, also known as online wallets, are connected to the internet and readily accessible for managing and conducting transactions with cryptocurrencies. They can be software-based wallets, mobile apps, or web-based wallets provided by cryptocurrency exchanges or service providers. Some characteristics of HOT wallets include:\n\n- Connectivity: HOT wallets are connected to the internet, enabling quick and convenient access to cryptocurrency holdings from various devices.\n- Accessibility: They allow users to manage their digital assets, initiate transactions, and interact with cryptocurrency networks in real-time.\n- Convenience: HOT wallets are user-friendly and often provide additional features such as integration with exchanges or easy conversion between different cryptocurrencies.\n- Vulnerability: Due to their online nature, HOT wallets are more susceptible to security breaches, hacking attempts, malware, and phishing attacks. The private keys, which grant access to the cryptocurrency funds, are stored online, making them potentially vulnerable.\n\nHOT wallets are suitable for users who frequently engage in cryptocurrency transactions, require quick access to their funds, and are willing to accept a certain level of risk associated with online storage.\n\n2. COLD Wallets:\nCOLD wallets, also known as offline wallets or hardware wallets, are designed to store cryptocurrency assets in an offline or isolated environment. They provide a higher level of security by keeping the private keys offline and away from potential online threats. Some key features of COLD wallets include:\n\n- Security: COLD wallets prioritize security by storing private keys on physical devices that are not connected to the internet. This significantly reduces the risk of online attacks and unauthorized access to funds.\n- Offline Storage: Private keys are generated and stored on the hardware wallet, which is typically a small, dedicated device. The wallet remains disconnected from the internet except when required to initiate transactions.\n- Protection Against Malware: As COLD wallets operate in an isolated environment, they are immune to malware or viruses that may exist on the user's computer or smartphone.\n- Transaction Signing: COLD wallets enable users to sign transactions securely within the offline environment. The signed transaction can then be transferred to a connected device for broadcasting to the blockchain network.\n\nCOLD wallets are ideal for users who prioritize security and long-term storage of their cryptocurrency holdings. They are particularly recommended for holding significant amounts of cryptocurrencies or for those who prefer a high level of control over their private keys.\n\nIn summary, HOT wallets are connected to the internet, easily accessible, and offer convenience but are more susceptible to security risks. On the other hand, COLD wallets provide enhanced security through offline storage, protection against online threats, and secure transaction signing, albeit with less accessibility and convenience. The choice between the two depends on the user's preferences, the amount of cryptocurrency held, and the intended usage of the funds. Some users may even opt to use a combination of both types for different purposes.\n\n|            | HOT Wallets                                  | COLD Wallets                                          |\n|------------|-------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|\n| Connectivity     | Connected to the internet                     | Offline                                                |\n| Accessibility     | Quick and convenient access                    | Limited access, requires connection for transactions  |\n| Convenience        | User-friendly with additional features     | Less user-friendly, limited functionality              |\n| Security                | More vulnerable to online attacks                | Higher level of security against online threats            |\n| Private Key Storage | Private keys stored online                           | Private keys stored offline on physical devices        |\n| Protection against malware      | Vulnerable to malware and phishing attacks               | Immune to malware and viruses                              |\n| Transaction Signing | Transactions signed online                           | Transactions signed offline in an isolated environment |\n\n## Distinguish between altcoins and tokens\nAltcoins and tokens are both types of cryptocurrencies, but they have some key differences. Here's a distinction between altcoins and tokens:\n\nAltcoins:\n- Altcoins are alternative cryptocurrencies that are alternative to Bitcoin, the first and most well-known cryptocurrency.\n- Altcoins have their own blockchain and are independent of Bitcoin's blockchain.\n- Examples of altcoins include Ethereum (ETH), Litecoin (LTC), Ripple (XRP), and many others.\n- Altcoins typically have their own consensus mechanisms, native networks, and utility or value proposition beyond being a digital currency.\n- Altcoins can be used for various purposes, such as creating smart contracts, enabling decentralized applications, or providing specific features not found in Bitcoin.\n\nTokens:\n- Tokens are a representation of assets or utility on an existing blockchain platform, such as Ethereum.\n- Tokens do not have their own independent blockchain but are built on top of an existing blockchain infrastructure.\n- Tokens are created and operate within the ecosystem of a specific blockchain platform.\n- Examples of tokens include ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum network, such as Tether (USDT) and Chainlink (LINK).\n- Tokens can serve various purposes, such as representing ownership of a particular asset (security tokens), providing access to a platform's services or features (utility tokens), or representing a specific digital asset or commodity (asset-backed tokens).\n\nIn summary, altcoins are independent cryptocurrencies with their own blockchain, while tokens are digital assets or representations of value that operate on existing blockchain platforms. Altcoins are separate cryptocurrencies, while tokens are created within a specific blockchain ecosystem.\n## Explain UTXO\nUTXO stands for Unspent Transaction Output and refers to the output of a transaction that has not been used as an input in any subsequent transaction. In other words, a UTXO represents a specific amount of cryptocurrency that has been sent to a recipient but has not yet been spent or used in another transaction.\n\nHere are some key points to understand about UTXOs:\n\n1. UTXO Model: UTXO is a fundamental concept in cryptocurrencies that use the UTXO model, such as Bitcoin. In this model, the transaction history is represented as a chain of UTXOs rather than account balances.\n\n2. UTXO Structure: Each UTXO has a unique identifier (transaction ID and output index) and contains information about the amount of cryptocurrency and the recipient's public key or script that can unlock the funds. UTXOs are stored in the blockchain and are referenced as inputs when creating new transactions.\n\n3. UTXO-Based Transactions: When a user wants to initiate a transaction, they need to provide one or more UTXOs as inputs to the transaction. The sum of the UTXOs' amounts must be equal to or greater than the desired transaction amount. The transaction consumes the UTXOs as inputs and creates new UTXOs as outputs, which can be spent in future transactions.\n\n4. UTXO Ownership: UTXOs are owned by the recipient of the original transaction. To spend a UTXO, the owner needs to provide a digital signature, proving ownership of the corresponding private key. This signature is verified during the validation of new transactions.\n\n5. UTXO Tracking: UTXOs are tracked by the nodes in the network to ensure that they have not been spent or double-spent in subsequent transactions. This allows for the verification of transaction validity and prevents the creation of fraudulent transactions.\n\n6. UTXO-Based Security: The UTXO model provides security benefits by ensuring that each transaction input references a specific UTXO. This makes it difficult to tamper with past transactions or modify the transaction history without detection.\n\n7. UTXO Chain: The UTXOs are organized in a chain, forming the transaction history. Each new transaction consumes existing UTXOs and creates new ones, maintaining the chain of ownership and transaction flow.\n\nThe UTXO model offers advantages such as improved privacy, scalability, and the ability to parallelize transaction processing. However, it also introduces complexities compared to account-based models, especially in terms of handling change outputs and managing transaction inputs and outputs efficiently.\n\nOverall, UTXOs play a crucial role in transaction validation, ownership tracking, and maintaining the integrity of the blockchain in UTXO-based cryptocurrency networks like Bitcoin.\n## Explain \"Consensus in Bitcoin\"\nConsensus in Bitcoin refers to the mechanism by which participants in the Bitcoin network agree on the validity of transactions and the order in which they are added to the blockchain. Bitcoin's consensus protocol ensures that all nodes in the network reach a shared agreement on the state of the blockchain without the need for a central authority.\n\nThe consensus in Bitcoin is achieved through a process called Proof of Work (PoW), specifically a concept called \"mining.\" Here's how it works:\n\n1. Transaction Propagation: When a user initiates a Bitcoin transaction, it is broadcasted to the network, and nodes receive and verify the transaction's validity.\n\n2. Block Formation: Valid transactions are grouped together into blocks, which are essentially collections of transactions. Miners compete to create new blocks by solving a computationally intensive mathematical puzzle known as the \"hash puzzle.\"\n\n3. Proof of Work: Miners use their computational power to find a hash value that meets certain predefined criteria. This process requires significant computational effort, making it difficult and time-consuming to find a valid solution. Miners continuously iterate through different nonce values until they find a hash value that meets the criteria (specifically, the hash value must be below a certain target value).\n\n4. Validating and Verifying Blocks: Once a miner finds a valid solution, they broadcast the block to the network. Other nodes in the network receive the block and verify the correctness of the solution and the included transactions.\n\n5. Consensus and Longest Chain Rule: Nodes in the network accept the longest valid chain as the valid version of the blockchain. If multiple blocks are mined simultaneously, creating multiple valid chains, the network automatically selects the chain with the most accumulated Proof of Work as the canonical chain. This mechanism ensures that all nodes agree on the order and validity of transactions, as it is highly unlikely for an attacker to possess more computational power than the rest of the network combined.\n\n6. Block Rewards: Miners who successfully mine a new block are rewarded with a certain amount of newly created bitcoins, as well as transaction fees included in the block.\n\nConsensus in Bitcoin, based on Proof of Work, provides a decentralized and secure way to validate and order transactions. It ensures that all nodes in the network agree on the state of the blockchain, prevents double-spending of bitcoins, and maintains the integrity of the system without relying on a centralized authority.\n\nIt's worth noting that there are alternative consensus mechanisms, such as Proof of Stake (PoS), being used or proposed in other blockchain networks that offer different approaches to achieving consensus. However, Bitcoin's consensus mechanism remains based on Proof of Work.\n## Differentiate between PoW, PoS and PoB\n\n\n|             | Proof of Work (PoW)                 | Proof of Stake (PoS)                            | Proof of Burn (PoB)                                      |\n|-------------|------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------|\n| Concept     | Miners solve computationally intensive puzzles to validate transactions and create new blocks.   | Validators are chosen to create new blocks based on the amount of cryptocurrency they hold and \"stake\" in the network. | Users burn (destroy) their existing cryptocurrency tokens to prove their commitment to the network and earn the right to mine or validate transactions. |\n| Key Mechanism     | Computational work (hashing puzzles)      | Ownership and staking of cryptocurrency        | Destruction of existing cryptocurrency tokens                             |\n| Energy Consumption | High energy consumption due to intensive computation required.        | Lower energy consumption compared to PoW.           | No ongoing energy consumption, but initial token burning requires energy. |\n| Security    | High security due to the significant computational power required to attack the network. | Security is based on the amount of cryptocurrency held and the economic incentives of the validators to act honestly. | Security is based on the assumption that burning existing tokens represents a financial cost and commitment to the network. |\n| Scalability | Can be resource-intensive and may face scalability challenges as the network grows. | Generally more scalable than PoW, but still subject to potential scalability limitations. | Scalability depends on the underlying consensus mechanism employed after the initial token burning. |\n| Coin Creation | New coins are created as a reward for miners who successfully mine new blocks. | No new coins are created, but validators earn transaction fees and potentially receive a share of transaction fees from the network. | No new coins are created through burning; existing coins are effectively removed from circulation. |\n| Participation | Open to anyone with computational resources to mine. | Requires ownership of the cryptocurrency and the ability to stake it. | Open to anyone with existing cryptocurrency tokens to burn. |\n\n## Explain the procedure of mining bitcoins by a miner\nMining bitcoins involves a miner using specialized hardware and software to participate in the Bitcoin network's consensus mechanism, which is based on the Proof of Work (PoW) algorithm. Here's a step-by-step explanation of the procedure of mining bitcoins by a miner:\n\n1. Acquiring Mining Hardware: The miner needs to obtain specialized mining hardware, such as Application-Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs) or Graphics Processing Units (GPUs). These devices are specifically designed to perform the complex calculations required for mining.\n\n2. Installing Mining Software: The miner installs mining software on their computer or mining rig. The software connects the hardware to the Bitcoin network and enables the miner to participate in the mining process.\n\n3. Joining a Mining Pool (optional): To increase their chances of earning rewards more consistently, miners often join mining pools. A mining pool is a group of miners who combine their computing power and share the rewards proportionally based on their contributions.\n\n4. Connecting to the Bitcoin Network: The mining software connects to the Bitcoin network and starts communicating with other nodes. It receives information about new transactions and blocks that need to be validated.\n\n5. Verifying Transactions: The mining software collects transactions from the network and verifies their validity. It checks if the sender has sufficient funds and ensures that the transaction follows the rules of the Bitcoin protocol.\n\n6. Constructing a Block: Once a sufficient number of valid transactions are collected, the miner begins constructing a new block. The block includes a list of transactions, a timestamp, and a reference to the previous block.\n\n7. Solving the Hash Puzzle: The most critical step in the mining process is solving a cryptographic hash puzzle. Miners use their computing power to perform numerous calculations, trying to find a hash value that meets certain criteria. This involves repeatedly changing a value called the \"nonce\" until a valid hash is found.\n\n8. Finding the Winning Solution: The miner who finds a valid hash first is rewarded with the right to add their block to the blockchain. This miner broadcasts the new block to the network.\n\n9. Network Validation: Other miners and nodes in the network receive the new block and validate its contents and the solution to the hash puzzle. If the block is deemed valid, it is added to the blockchain, and the miner receives a reward in the form of newly created bitcoins and transaction fees.\n\n10. Repeat the Process: Miners continuously repeat the process of verifying transactions, constructing blocks, and solving hash puzzles to mine new blocks and contribute to the security and operation of the Bitcoin network.\n\nIt's important to note that mining bitcoins has become highly competitive, and the difficulty of solving the hash puzzle adjusts regularly based on the overall computing power in the network. As a result, individual miners often join mining pools or invest in more powerful hardware to improve their chances of mining successfully.\n# Module 3\n## What is a smart contract? Explain its Characteristics\nA smart contract is a self-executing digital contract that automatically enforces and executes the terms of an agreement between two or more parties. It is built on blockchain technology, typically using platforms like Ethereum, and is governed by a set of predefined rules and conditions. Smart contracts eliminate the need for intermediaries or trusted third parties, as the execution and enforcement of the contract terms are automated and secured by the blockchain. Here are some key characteristics of smart contracts:\n\n1. Automation: Smart contracts are designed to execute automatically once the predefined conditions are met. There is no need for manual intervention or reliance on intermediaries to enforce the contract terms. The automation ensures that the contract is executed precisely as agreed upon, reducing the potential for human error or manipulation.\n\n2. Self-Enforcement: Smart contracts use cryptographic code to enforce the terms and conditions of the agreement. The execution of the contract is based on a series of predefined rules and algorithms, eliminating the need for trust between parties. The contract code cannot be tampered with or altered once it is deployed on the blockchain, providing a high level of security and immutability.\n\n3. Transparency: Smart contracts are typically deployed on a public blockchain, making them transparent and visible to all participants. The code and the contract's execution history are stored on the blockchain, allowing anyone to verify and audit the contract's behavior. This transparency enhances trust and ensures that the contract's execution is open and accessible to all parties involved.\n\n4. Trustlessness: Smart contracts operate on a trustless system, meaning that participants do not need to trust each other for the contract to be executed correctly. Instead, they rely on the consensus mechanism and the underlying blockchain technology to validate and enforce the contract's terms. The decentralized nature of blockchain ensures that no single party has control or authority over the contract.\n\n5. Efficiency and Cost Reduction: Smart contracts automate the execution and enforcement of contract terms, eliminating the need for intermediaries, paperwork, and manual processes. This increases efficiency, reduces administrative costs, and speeds up the contract execution process. Additionally, since there are no intermediaries involved, the costs associated with their services or fees are minimized.\n\n6. Programmability: Smart contracts are programmable, allowing developers to create complex logic and conditions within the contract code. This flexibility enables the creation of sophisticated applications and decentralized protocols on top of the blockchain. Developers can leverage programming languages and frameworks specific to smart contract development to define and implement the contract's logic.\n\n7. Conditional Execution: Smart contracts can include conditional statements that determine when and how specific actions or payments should be executed. These conditions can be time-based triggers, events, or specific inputs from external systems. The contract automatically responds to these conditions and carries out the predetermined actions accordingly.\n\nOverall, smart contracts offer a decentralized, secure, and efficient way to create, execute, and enforce digital agreements. They provide a trustless environment, enhance transparency, and reduce the reliance on intermediaries, making them suitable for a wide range of applications, including financial transactions, supply chain management, governance systems, and more.\n## Explain Different types of Smart Contracts\nThere are several different types of smart contracts, each serving a specific purpose and catering to different functionalities. Here are some of the common types of smart contracts:\n\n1. Payment Contracts: Payment contracts are one of the most basic and widely used types of smart contracts. They facilitate the transfer of digital currencies or tokens between parties based on predefined conditions. Payment contracts can be used for various purposes, including salary payments, remittances, peer-to-peer transactions, and micropayments.\n\n2. Escrow Contracts: Escrow contracts act as a trusted intermediary, holding funds or assets in escrow until certain conditions are met. These contracts are commonly used in transactions where trust is essential, such as online marketplaces or real estate deals. The funds or assets are released from escrow to the intended recipient only when all conditions are fulfilled.\n\n3. Multi-Signature Contracts: Multi-signature contracts, also known as multi-sig contracts, require multiple parties to sign off on a transaction for it to be executed. These contracts enhance security and eliminate the need for a single point of control or trust. They are often used for joint accounts, corporate governance, or any situation where multiple parties must provide consent for a transaction to occur.\n\n4. Supply Chain Contracts: Supply chain contracts enable the automation and tracking of goods or products throughout the supply chain process. They can include conditions related to the origin, quality, quantity, and delivery of goods. By using smart contracts in supply chain management, stakeholders can have real-time visibility into the movement and verification of products, enhancing transparency and reducing fraud.\n\n5. Tokenization Contracts: Tokenization contracts represent the creation and management of digital tokens on a blockchain. These tokens can represent various assets such as real estate, commodities, or even virtual assets within a game. Tokenization contracts define the rules and conditions for the creation, distribution, ownership, and transfer of tokens, allowing for fractional ownership and enhanced liquidity.\n\n6. Decentralized Exchange Contracts: Decentralized exchange contracts enable peer-to-peer trading of digital assets without the need for a centralized exchange. These contracts facilitate the matching of buy and sell orders and handle the settlement of trades in a transparent and secure manner. Decentralized exchanges leverage smart contracts to automate the order book, trade execution, and custody of assets.\n\n7. Governance Contracts: Governance contracts are used to define and execute decentralized decision-making processes within a blockchain ecosystem. These contracts enable token holders or community members to participate in voting, propose changes, and make collective decisions regarding protocol upgrades, funding allocations, or changes to network parameters.\n\n8. Insurance Contracts: Insurance contracts on the blockchain automate the process of policy issuance, premium payments, and claims settlement. Smart contracts can enforce the terms and conditions of an insurance policy, automatically pay out claims based on predefined triggers or external data sources, and ensure transparency and efficiency in the insurance process.\n\nThese are just a few examples of the different types of smart contracts. The flexibility and programmability of smart contracts allow for the creation of customized contracts that cater to specific business requirements and use cases in various industries.","lastmodified":"2023-05-22T03:06:06.345499322Z","tags":["technology"]},"/notes/Short-note":{"title":"Short note","content":"short","lastmodified":"2023-05-22T03:06:06.345499322Z","tags":[]},"/notes/THE-FORGING-OF-THE-SADVIPRA-1-PASHU":{"title":"The Forging Of The Sadvipra 1","content":"[[sadvipra]]\nThe first level of the Tantra aspirant is that of an animal. The Hitopadesha explains this state saying,\n\n_츼h치ra nidr치 bhaya maethunai攷귺a s치m치nyametad pashubhiirnar치n치m;  \nDharmo hi te콑amadhiko vishe콑o dharmena hiin치h pashubhih s치m치n치h._(Hitopadesha 25)  \n[Food, sleep, fear and mating, these acts of humans are similar to animals. Of them (humans), Dharma (righteous conduct rooted in spirituality) is the only special thing, without Dharma humans are also animals.]\n\nShrii Sarkar explains the difference between animals and human beings saying,\n\n\u003e Those guided by mere inborn instincts are called 딿ashu or animals. So those who have certain inborn instincts, but who are basically guided by intellect or mind, are known as 딷uman beings.\n\u003e \n\u003e _The Minimum Qualifications for a S치dhaka_\n\nShrii Sarkar explains this further saying,\n\n\u003e Those who are in pashu form have to elevate themselves to the standard of man-god, that is, God. Pashu form means always moving in order to eat, drink, or sleep  for these things. They will have to elevate their standard to become human both in mind and body. This style of practice is known as pashv치c치ra, as taught by Lord Shiva about seven thousand years ago.\n\u003e \n\u003e _The Three Species of Human Being_\n\nHowever, this state is animality in a human body causes clash in the human mind. As a result the pashu starts to develop awareness. As Shrii Sarkar states,\n\n\u003e Sarve ca pashavah santi. In the first stage of creation, all beings are animal-like. In the age of material predominance, their features in the material sphere are more prominent and manifested. The rhythm of speed of progress maintains a balance with the objects of the material world. This stage is called 랋ashv치c치ra. In this stage people become capable of deciding how to proceed, where to go and what the final goal of life is. Because of their being animal-like spiritualists call them 랋ashu. Shiva is called by the name of Pashupati at this stage.\n\u003e \n\u003e _Pashupati, Viireshvara, and Mah치deva, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 5_\n\nShrii Sarkar explains the character of the pashu as follows:\n\n\u003e _Sarve ca pashavah santi talavad bh칰tale nar치h;  \n\u003e Te콑치拷 ji攷치na prak치sh치ya viirabh치vah prak치shitah._  \n\u003e _Viirabh치va拷 sad치 pr치pya krame켻a devat치 bhavet._  \n\u003e  Rudray치mala Tantra  \n\u003e [In the beginning everyone is a pashu, an animal. But when spiritual thirst develops, these people become viira, heroic. And when they are firmly established in viirabh치va (mental stance of a viira), they become devat치s (gods).]  \n\u003e Now the question is, have these pashus, these animals, these brutes, no future? Certainly they have. Because the Supreme Progenitor [Brahma] is with everybody, and He is with these animals-in-human-form also. And a pashu whose object of adoration, that is, whose goal of life, is that very Parama Puru콑a, will address Him as  what? As Pashupati [Lord of Animals뗗. O Lord, O Parama Puru콑a, we are pashus, we are animals, and Thou art Lord of the animals, Thou art Pashupati.뙉  \n\u003e So one of the names of Parama Puru콑a is Pashupati. For sleeping humanity, the Supreme Consciousness, Supreme Entity, is Pashupati  \n\u003e Now, I have said that a person has three types of expression: One expression is thinking, the thinking faculty, and the second one is speaking In the first the function is within the nerve cells, and in the second, the function is  where? With the lips. And the third action is action with the physical body, corporal action.  \n\u003e Now in the case of pashus, that is, animals in human structure, the thought-waves move like this and the lips speak like this and the actions are like that! There is no adjustment amongst these three expressions. The person is a pashu, the person is in the stage of pashu, in the stage of animality, although the structure is like that of a human. In the society these people are in the majority, and others are in a hopeless minority; and I want you boys and you girls to try your best to decrease the number of these pashus.\n\u003e \n\u003e _From Animality to Divinity, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 1_\n\nThese pashus most often find it difficult to perform meditation due to their crude minds. Hence their primary relationship is through prayers. As Shrii Sarkar says,\n\n\u003e Common men, ordinary created beings, feel that there is some controller, some controlling entity. They also feel that they are ordinary beings, but that controlling entity controls those ordinary beings; so that controlling entity is not at all a heavenly body, but something of the physical world, something very near, something having a close proximity to their existence. Ordinary created beings are just like animals, eating, drinking, sleeping, dying. They say, O Creator, O Controller, we are just like animals, we are just like pashu; You are our Lord. You just liberate us from the bondage of crudity. You are Pashupati, we are pashu; You are Pashupati. You just elevate our standard and lead us to the stance of supreme humanity, supreme divinity.\n\u003e \n\u003e _Parama Puru콑a the Great_\n\nThe increase of animality in human society since WWII in particular has brought about chaos and a complete breakdown of laws and justice. Shrii Sarkar explains how humanity will emerge from this crisis saying,\n\n\u003e That being which moves for the sake of movement, is called an animal (pashu). To say that an animal is a being which has an animal-like body is incorrect; it is more precise to say that an animal is a being which is guided by only a few inborn instinctive momenta, thus many human beings can be said to be animalistic. When the number of animal-like humans increases, human society and culture rapidly degenerate. This is the situation in the world today. But this social and cultural collapse will be overcome in the future,  \n\u003e In the long history of humanity periods of degeneration have come and gone. When the number of animals in human form increases, rational people become more active to save society. In response to their collective prayer, Parama Brahma, the Supreme Entity, applies a special power so that human civilization is saved from annihilation, and injected with new life to enable it to advance with fresh momentum.  \n\u003e Whenever the nadir point of degeneration is reached, the Supreme Entity applies His special power. This power takes the form of His Mah치sambh칰ti [special manifestation]. He applies His special power in the world when rules and regulations no longer remain effective, when institutions and values crumble. The special advent of Mah치sambh칰ti signifies that the human race will have a new awakening.\n\u003e \n\u003e _Cognitive Faculty and the Supreme Desideratum_\n\nShrii Sarkar explains the struggle of the pashus as follows:\n\n\u003e By birth all human beings are just like animals. They are bound by the fetters of so many p치shas and ripus, bondages and enemies of mind. In this first phase, with the blessings of the Lord, they start their struggle.  \n\u003e And what is this struggle? It is the struggle against those fetters while moving towards the Goal. In this struggle they are emboldened by the support of the M치y치. This first phase of struggle in tantra Sadhana is called pashv치c치r in Sa拷쯥krta, for here the spiritual aspirants are to some extent like animals; and so the fight against all those nooses of p치shas and ripus is known as the fight of an animal  the pashv치c치ra in Sa拷쯥krta.  \n\u003e Now while struggling against those binding principles they badly need the grace of the lord, and in their inner voice they address the Lord as Pashupati, the Lord of the animals: O Lord, I am a pashu, an animal, and Thou art my Lord, Thou art Pashupati. So in the first phase of spiritual movement Sad치shiva or the Guru is known as Pashupati.\n\u003e \n\u003e _The Essence of Spiritual Progress_\n\n#### Ripus and Pashas  \n\nWhat are the ripus and pashas? The idea of the ripus emerged in the Yajurveda where the ripus are represented by animals of a similar nature. The idea of the pashas emerged from Tantra. These are not abstract concepts but rather fundamental propensities (vrttis) of our biopsychology related to specific cakras and glands of an individual.\n\nShrii Sarkar explains the ripus as follows:\n\n\u003e The underlying weaknesses which cause immense harm to human beings are called ripus [enemies]. They are six in number: k치ma [longing for physicality], krodha [anger], lobha [avarice], mada [vanity], moha [blind attachment], and m치tsarya [jealousy]. And when our various mental bondages exploit these ripus in order to tighten their grip on the mind, they become known as p치shas [fetters].\n\u003e \n\u003e -The Acoustic Roots of the Indo-Aryan Alphabet, Discourses on Tantra Volume One\n\nThe pashas are explained in the following words:\n\n\u003e These p치sha or fetters are eight in number:  \n\u003e Ghr켻asha拷쯞치bhaya拷쯟ajj치jugups치cetipai攷귺amii;  \n\u003e Kula拷쯥hiilai攷귺a m치nai攷귺a a콑t패ao p치sh치h prakiirtit치h.  \n\u003e [(1) hatred, (2) doubt, (3) fear, (4) shame, (5) censure, (6) attachment,  \n\u003e (7) vanity of one뗩 culture, (8) false sense of prestige.]  \n\u003e The one who consumes these fetters is known in the society as Pa켻dita, with the realization of Brahma or the attainment of Savikalpa Sam치dhi (determinate trance of absorption) the above fetters disappear from the human mind. During the time of determinate concentration the sentiment of I am Brahma, exists in the mind of the S치dhaka. In the Sa拷쯥krta language the state of I am Brahma is called Pa켻d치. The one who has Pa켻d치 is called Pa켻dita [scholar].\n\u003e \n\u003e _The Intuitional Science of the Vedas  4_\n\nShrii Sarkar explains hatred  one of the pashas  and how to overcome it saying,\n\n\u003e There are activities that provoke, as a reaction, a filthy sensation in the body or mind of a person. This induces in them a desire to stay away from such activities, and creates in them a mentality of over-reaction against such activities. This reactionary mentality is called ghr켻치 or hatred. Hatred is an imposed psychic bondage. So it is a kind of p치sha [eight types of external fetters]. What originates in the mind and expands to the external world is called ripu [six inherent bondages]. That which originates outside and influences the mind is called p치sha, as told earlier. An intelligent person keeps his or her ripu in control and fights the p치shas.  \n\u003e The sages and ascetics do not recommend any mechanism for opposing the ripus, because if a particular ripu is repressed, it tries to find an outlet through another ripu. The same is true about the remaining of ripus (lust, anger, greed, attachment, pride and jealousy). If the propensity of greed is strong in a person and they are compelled to control it under the pressure of poverty  for example, if a person who used to take bribes is compelled to refrain from taking bribes due to pressure from law enforcement authorities늢heir greed will find expression through anger or some other ripu; that is, they will burst into a rage.  \n\u003e So the recommended psychological stance is that a ripu must be kept under control, and under no circumstances should it be allowed to run counter to the society or to societal norms. Suppose someone has a strong weakness for eating. Overeating or eating prohibited food can naturally lead to sickness or premature death. So that person restrains their greed in such a manner that their greed is satisfied and at the same time potential disease is prevented. Suppose someone addicted to drink has become a slave of liquor under its strong influence. If they can sublimate their alcohol addiction into a passion for music or painting or any other finer art, then their passion will be satisfied without any injury to themselves.  \n\u003e Regarding the pashas, the wise people of ancient times expressed their strong conviction that the p치shas [imposed bondages of the mind  fear shame, doubt etc.] must be opposed. To fight fear, for example, one must move quickly towards the very source of that fear, equipped with necessary physical and psychological weapons. If you remain confined in your cloister, fearfully barring the door, the fear will make its way into your mind and there take root. Then the bondage of fear can never be thrown off. So always remember that ripus [inborn enemies  lust, angers, greed attachment, vanity and jealousy] must be controlled and p치shas [bondages] must be opposed. The endeavour to be liberated from the p치shas is a step forward in human expansiveness  an ascent towards human glory and excellence. P치shobaddho bhavejjibo p치shamukto bhavecchivah [Bound by p치sha is the jiiva, liberated from bondage is Shiva].  \n\u003e Your psychological reaction to a person뗩 behaviour or action that creates p치sha or provokes ripu is called hatred. Since hatred is also a type of p치sha, and it must be opposed through reasoning and intellect. The word ku can be used for this hatred.\n\u003e \n\u003e _Discourse 27, Shabda Cayanik치 Part 4_\n\nShrii Sarkar explains how these pashas harm the collective mind and society as follows:\n\n\u003e In the same way, contractive movement is dominated by Avidy치 [extroversial force of ignorance], and at its extreme limit it is embedded in the ultimate static point.  \n\u003e The contractive movement at its extreme point or point of apparent pause is expressed by the a콑t패a p치sha [eight fetters]: ghr켻치 [hatred], shau攷긂치 [doubt], bhaya [fear], lajj치 [shyness], jugup콑a [dissemblance], kula [vanity of lineage], shiila [cultural superiority complex] and m치na [egotism]. These eight fetters are created by the static state of mind, and [subsequently] the mind depends on these fetters in the course of its expansion.  \n\u003e These eight fetters supply the vital energy to isms or superstition. Isms, such as nationalism, casteism, provincialism, communalism, etc., create hatred and destroy human integrity.  \n\u003e The eight fetters also generate dissonance [doubt] and suspicion in the subtle layers of the mind, although they are not generally expressed in external behaviour.  \n\u003e It is 딸sms which are responsible for creating distrust [fear] between social groups. Hindus generally do not trust Muslims and vice versa, as both believe in their respective isms.\n\u003e \n\u003e _Ism and Human Progress, Prout in a Nutshell Volume 1 Part 4_\n\nShrii Sarkar shows how the very nature of India is to liberate all beings from the pashas saying,\n\n\u003e You know the Sanskrit name of India is Bh치ratavar콑a. The root verb bhar means 랎o feed or 랎o nourish, and the root verb tan means 랎o expand, 랎o grow. So the entity whose function is to feed, to nourish, and then help to grow, is called bh치rata. And thus the land which feeds its population and thereby helps in the physical, psychic and spiritual growth of that population is called Bh치ratavar콑a. (Var콑a means 랇and or 띾ountry.) Bh치ratavar콑a is a land which facilitates gradual growth and finally leads to emancipation; in other words, the mind and the soul gradually expand, and the soul becomes one with the Universal Soul. And in the state of highest expansion, all the eight fetters and six enemies of the human mind, that is, all the external [externally-imposed] and internal enemies of the human mind, will cease to exist; and thus when the microcosms are free from all bondages, they cease to remain as microcosms and become one with Shiva [Supreme Consciousness]. In Tantra it is said, P치shabaddha bhavet jiivah p치sha muktah bhavet Shivah  Those who are bound by the fetters are jiiva [unit consciousness] but one who is free from the fetters is Shiva.\n\u003e \n\u003e _Yoga, Tantra, and Keval치 Bhakti_\n\nHow are we to fight hate and the other pashas  with more hate? In the passage below Shrii Sarkar explains this beautifully saying,\n\n\u003e ==So one should wage war against these eight external bondages and six internal bondages. This fight is with the left hand, and with the right hand what is one to do? One is to serve the entire universe without any restriction of caste, creed or nationality, and with the sentiment of, with the feeling of, with the knowledge of, Neohumanism: The universe is mine; all living beings are mine. I am to serve them, I am to help them. If I don뗪 serve them, if I don뗪 help them, who else is to help them? If, in this way, you are fighting those inner and outer bondages with one hand, and serving the universe with the other hand, what will happen? Your existence will be blissful in each and every field of your movement. So one뗩 very existence will be joyful, one뗩 very existence will be blissful.==\n\u003e \n\u003e _Existential Flow and Its Culminating Point_\n\nFinally, Shrii Sarkar explains how morality can liberate us from the pashas saying,\n\n\u003e When one is established in Yama and Niyama, a콑t패a p치sha (the eight fetters) fall from the mind. One who is not fettered can never have superstitions.\n\u003e \n\u003e _Sadhana, Cary치carya Part 2_\n\n#### Yama and Niyama  \n\nYama and Niyama are Yantras or spiritual dynamos or engine and each of the principles is an upayantra (partial engine). These are vast concepts to be realised by meditation and struggle in our daily lives. It is important to note that the realization of these principles in our daily is our personal moral struggle and the realization of these principles in the collective life of society is the essence of what is PROUT. Shrii Sarkar, explains them briefly saying,\n\n\u003e Yama has five parts (i) Ahi拷쯥치, (ii) Satya, (iii) Asteya, iv) Brahmacarya, v) Aparigraha.  \n\u003e (i) Ahi拷쯥치: Not to inflict pain or hurt on anybody by thought, word or action, is Ahi拷쯥치.  \n\u003e (ii) Satya: The benevolent use of mind and words is Satya.  \n\u003e (iii) Asteya: To renounce the desire to acquire or retain the wealth of others is Asteya. Asteya means 랉on-stealing.  \n\u003e (iv) Brahmacarya: To keep the mind always absorbed in Brahma is Brahmacarya.  \n\u003e (v) Aparigraha: To renounce everything excepting the necessities for the maintenance of the body is known as Aparigraha.  \n\u003e Niyama has five parts  (i) Shaoca, (ii) Santo콑a, (iii) Tapah, (iv) Sv치dhy치ya, (v) Iishvara pra켻idh치na.  \n\u003e (i) Shaoca is of two kinds  purity of the body and of the mind. The methods for mental purity are kindliness towards all creatures, charity, working for the welfare of others and being dutiful.  \n\u003e (ii) Santo콑a Contentment with things received unasked-for is santo콑a. It is essential to try to be cheerful always.  \n\u003e (iii) Tapah: To undergo physical hardship to attain the objective is known as Tapah. Upav치sa (fasting), serving the guru (preceptor), serving father and mother, and the four types of yaji攷그, namely, pitr yaji攷그, nr yaji攷그, bh칰ta yaji攷그 and adhy치tma yaji攷그 (service to ancestors, to humanity, to lower beings and to Consciousness), are the other limbs of tapah. For students, study is the main tapah.  \n\u003e (iv) Sv치dhy치ya: The study, with proper understanding, of scriptures and philosophical books is sv치dhy치ya. The philosophical books and scriptures of Ananda Marga are 츼nanda S칰tram and Subh치콑ita Sa拷쯚raha (all parts), respectively. Sv치dhy치ya is also done by attending Dharmacakra (group meditation) regularly and having satsau攷귾a (spiritual company)  \n\u003e (v) Iishvara Pra켻idh치na: This is to have firm faith in Iishvara (the Cosmic Controller) in pleasure and pain, prosperity and adversity, and to think of oneself as the instrument, and not the wielder of the instrument, in all the affairs of life.\n\u003e \n\u003e -S치dhan치 (Intuitional Practice), Ananda Marga Cary치carya Part 2\n\nIt is important to note that Iishvara Pra켻idh치na is the 1st Lesson of Ananda Marga meditation. As we can see it cannot develop unless the other principles of Niyama (Shaoca, Santo콑a, Tapah and Sv치dhy치ya) are fully developed. Hence the unique nature of Tantra meditation is that without morality and sacrifice for the welfare of others, one will never be able to progress spiritually. Similarly Brahmacarya is the 2nd Lesson of Ananda Marga sadhana. Without meditation, Brahmacarya becomes impossible in daily life. Yet this form of sadhana cannot blossom unless the other principles of Yama (Ahimsa, Satya, Asteya and Aparigraha) also blossom in daily life.\n\n#### Yatam치na  \n\nOne of the fundamental parts of the famous 8-fold (Ast치u攷귾a) Yoga is Praty치h치ra. Shrii Sarkar briefly explains this saying,\n\n\u003e Praty치h치ra literally means 랑ithdrawal  withdrawing the unsteady mind from the allurement of particular objects. Var켻치rghyad치na [Guru P칰j치], offering the colours of the mind to M치rga Guru, is the simplest means for withdrawal, but this process of praty치h치ra can be practised even if M치rga Guru is not present in His physical form. 츼c치rya/치s will give training in praty치h치ra.\n\u003e \n\u003e _Sadhana, Ananda Marga Cary치carya Part 1_\n\nThere are various stages of this spiritual process as Shrii Sarkar explains:\n\n\u003e Thus the psycho-spiritual path is divided into four stages: yatam치na, vyatireka, ekendriya and vashiik치ra. When the mind hovers between the crude and the subtle it is the yatamana stage. When, after vacillating between petty gains and losses one wishes to want to snap the bondage of gains and losses for good and plunge into the world of psychic bliss, it is the second stage, vyatireka. When bliss comes like a flood of light on a moonlit night, it is ekendriya. And when one strives hard to establish oneself in the absolute word by suspending all the mundane longings through psycho-spiritual endeavour it is vashiik치ra.\n\u003e \n\u003e _Vashiik치ra  1, Ananda Marga Philosophy in a Nutshell Part 6_\n\nThe first stage that is associated with the spiritual practice of the pashu is Yatam치na. Shrii Sarkar explains:\n\n\u003e Yatam치na is derived from the Sa拷쯥krta root verb 땇ata+ suffix 땁h치nac and means 딾ne who is endeavouring (the effort is still continuing) It is when the human mind is dedicated to the welfare of the entire humanity without any discrimination, when the sole intention is to promote universal well-being. When the human mind, motivated by such sentiments, engages itself in action through the body, only that action can be treated as real yatam치na. Other endeavours should not be defined as such  \n\u003e ==What should be done to bring about progress in the yatam치na stage? One should learn the proper philosophy from a competent person. In order to judge what is a proper philosophy and what is a pseudo-philosophy, one should see how far the philosophy goes in treating the entire humanity as a singular entity and promoting its unity. Only that philosophy which inculcates universal sentiments is acceptable to human beings, for it alone reflects the spirit of yatam치na.== Other philosophies will spoil the human treasures resulting in humans, even though they are endowed with eyes, feet, hands, etc., degenerating to the level of animality, or even below that. Animals quarrel among themselves or with others to procure food, but these crude people, even though they do not need to procure food for their survival, misuse their authority to destroy or subjugate innocent humans being.  \n\u003e The people of today must understand this basic fact and remain vigilant against the detrimental actions of the intellectual satans and blood-sucking exploiters. The people of today must move ahead while fighting against the two enemies  the bloodsuckers who exploit in the economic sphere, and the intellectual satans who not only exploit human beings but bring them down to the level of animality. I request the present human race to continue their endless fight on these two fronts. They should remember that on both these fronts they are fighting against enemies who, being guided by dogma, have no logic in their method of exploitation. Though they are exploiting people in the socio-economic, socio-intellectual and spiritual spheres, once their conscience is aroused against dogma, their exploitation will automatically cease. The gigantic demons of exploitation will vanish in a flash.\n\u003e \n\u003e -Yatam치na  1, Ananda Marga Philosophy in a Nutshell Part 6\n\nThis is a state where one experiences tremendous obstacles from family and society. However these obstacles are crucial in the forging of the sadhaka (spiritual aspirant) into a Sadvipra. Shrii Sarkar notes,\n\n\u003e ==Since yatam치na is a state of transformation, the environment exerts its deep influence on it. While at home, one may remain in the state of yatam치na. It may be that one뗩 family members are creating great obstacles, and forcefully saying, Eat this [non-sentient food] or Do this now, Now we will not let you do this  in this manner they create all kinds of barriers. Now one has fallen amidst multiple obstacles and tests. Maybe, for some, such obstacles and tests are of a lesser degree. In case of a person who experiences such obstacles to a lesser degree, the kal치 [mental curvatures] is not properly transformed into k치콑t패h치 [linear flow of a righteous person]. At that moment, obstacles are a great necessity. Obstacles should appear. One should invite obstacles. What is the benefit if obstacles come along the path? The transformation of kal치 [sysltaltic flow] into k치콑t패h치 [linear flow] will be accelerated. Obstacles will appear in personal life, in the collective life, in social life, in all spheres of human life. Obstacles need to come and are desirable. If you struggle against obstacles, you will stand to gain and will never lose. That is why obstacles are to be considered as friends.  \n\u003e Let us suppose, someone throttles you and says, I will not let your natural expression of language manifest itself. If you oppose such a person and you are determined to fight against them, then what happens? Your kal치 will get transformed into k치콑t패h치, because when your kal치 is pitted against crude external obstacles, it is transformed. This is the state of yatam치na.==\n\u003e \n\u003e -Yatam치na  the Stage of Perseverance, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 10\n\nThe psychology of this first stage are defined by Shrii Sarkar as follows:\n\n\u003e In yatam치na, the first stage, the mental propensities are directed towards the citta [objective mind, mind-stuff]. It is a very difficult stage: difficulties arise from within as well as without. The internal difficulties are created by the untrained mental propensities, which misbehave like wild animals. After a moment of control, off they go again, dashing about like unbroken horses.\n\u003e \n\u003e Yatam치na, Vyatireka, Ekendriya and Vashiik치ra, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 33\n\n#### Bhav치nii Shakti\n\nIn Tantric cosmology, the operative principle or creative principle (Shakti) of Shiva (the Cognitive Principle) evolves in various ways. It is important to state that both principles are one and comprise the nature of Consciousness. In the material universe which dominates the mind of the pashu, the particular manifestation of Shakti is Bhav치nii Shakti. This Shakti evolves as part of Brahmacakra or the Cycle of Creation from Pure Consciousness to matter and from matter back unto Consciousness. Shrii Sarkar comments regarding the evolution of this form of Shakti saying\n\n\u003e When Cosmic Idea (bh치va) turns into action, where the oneness of the singular Supreme Entity is transformed into many, it is known as Bhav치nii Shakti.\n\u003e \n\u003e -Discourse 22, Shabda Cayanik치 Part 4\n\nIn the evolution of the Cosmic Mind, after the evolution of the pure feeling of Cosmic existence (mahat) there evolves the Cosmic ego (aham). The evolution of mahat is in the form of a straight line. However, the evolution of aham is in the form of a curved flow. Thereafter the evolution of the Cosmic Citta (mind-stuff, ectoplasm) unfolds in numerous curvilinear flows in the 7 realms of Citta. In the last realm there evolves the rudimental factors of matter and later the endless lifeforms of the universe. This entire series of curvilinear flows is called kal치. Shrii Sarkar explains how these curvilinear evolutes of Consciousness are transcended saying,\n\n\u003e The vibrational phase [kal치] is called bhava  also bhava s치gara or bhava p치r치v치ra [ocean of creation]. The word bhava thus denotes the entire realm of the vibrational principle. This is the world of mundane involvements. The Caetanya, or Cognitive Principle of this faculty is called Bhava, and the Shakti, or Operative Principle of this faculty is called Bhav치nii Shakti. This is the worldly bondage. Only through the medium of Hari kath치 [stories of the Lord뗩 divine drama] can one cross this ocean of bhava, the entire range of the vibrational faculty.\n\u003e \n\u003e -Mantra Caetanya, Subh치콑ita Sa拷쯚raha Part 10\n\nThe first stage is for this Shakti to be sublimated into a higher form of Shakti. As Shrii Sarkar explains,\n\n\u003e If one뗩 movement is towards the crude, one뗩 psycho-physical waves will become cruder and cruder. But if one뗩 movement is towards the Supreme, if Bhav치nii Shakti is transformed into Bhaeravii Shakti, then one뗩 waves will gradually straighten. The subtle waves of effulgence will also become straight. Thus a devotee뗩 movement towards the Supreme One is an endeavour to transform crude energy into subtle energy. To transform Bhav치nii Shakti into Bhaeravii Shakti both shraddh치 [implicit veneration for one뗩 goal] and viirya [heroic stamina] are important. Without regular spiritual practice this transformation is impossible.  \n\u003e For a devotee, action is indispensable. S치dhan치 itself is a type of action. If one sits idle like a piece of inert matter, s치dhan치 is impossible; the conversion of crude into subtle will never occur. The relationship between devotees and their Lord is strengthened through action. At this point a question may arise: on the path of s치dhan치 who is greater  a bhakta [devotee] or a karmii [person of action]? The answer is simple and straightforward. For bhaktas all actions are a part of their psycho-spiritual practice, whereas for karmiis actions are merely seen as actions. Those people whose actions are indistinguishable from devotion are true devotees. Thus in the process of conversion of Bhav치nii Shakti into Bhaeravii Shakti, devotion plays a greater role than so-called action  \n\u003e Devotees will have to straighten the waves of Bhav치nii Shakti. The more the waves are straightened, the more Bhav치nii will be transformed into Bhaeravii Shakti. This straightening of the waves is the first stage of s치dhan치. As long as s치dhakas remain within the scope of Bhav치nii Shakti they observe that all finite entities of the universe are separate from one another  \n\u003e When major changes occur in Bhav치nii Shakti, ether, air, fire, water and other crude objects can be perceived. These entities acquire different forms due to the differences in the waves created by the three principles. Thus we observe the same Puru콑a manifested in different ways.  \n\u003e It is due to a particular vibration of Bhav치nii Shakti that we perceive Puru콑a as a piece of iron, and due to another vibration that we perceive Puru콑a as a piece of gold. Had there been no differences among the wavelengths of Bhav치nii Shakti, there would have been no differences among the manifested objects. When spiritual aspirants remain within the periphery of Bhav치nii Shakti and observe the differences among objects, they realize the Supreme Singularity behind the diversity of expression.  \n\u003e All objects are the varying forms of Puru콑a. When one realizes that all these diverse objects finally merge into His supreme singularity, social service becomes more important than anything else, because service to individuals or the collectivity means service to Brahma.  \n\u003e So in the first stage of s치dhan치, as a result of the constant superimposition of Cosmic ideation, Bhav치nii Shakti is changed into Bhaeravii Shakti. Then all the objects of the world are seen as expressions of Brahma. This realization is not brought about by the study of books. Book knowledge is only perceptional knowledge; it cannot take one beyond the boundary of perception. If people study constantly without practising s치dhan치, psycho-physical parallelism will make them vain and egotistical.\n\u003e \n\u003e -The Devotee and the Lord, Subh치콑ita Sa拷쯚raha Part 8\n\n## 1st Lesson\n\nNow let us briefly examine the nature of the First Lesson of basic Ananda Marga meditation (Sahaja Yoga). In truth since meditation is a practice, it is only to be understood in the laboratory of one뗩 inner self. Below is the explanation of this lesson by a senior meditator.\n\n**Understanding the First Lesson of 츼nanda M치rga Sahaja Yoga  \n(IISHVARA PRA켺IDH츼NA)**  \n_By Acarya Cidghanananda Avadhuta_\n\nThe first lesson of the Tantra Yoga is known as Iishvara Pra켻idh치na. In Iishvara Pra켻idh치na, during the first phase, three factors are very, very important: mantra diipanii (withdrawal), mantra 치gh치t (repetition of the mantra), and mantra caetanya (ideation on the meaning of the mantra). In this process the principle of one뗩 conversion of subjectivity into objectivity is applied. Oneness with objectivity results in oneness with subjectivity. Mind is a most restless thinking entity. The very existence of the mind is due to the expression of I-ness. This I-ness remains scattered all over a person뗩 body and mind. So, first of all the withdrawal of mind from objective physicality, then the expansion of the mind, are taken into account.\n\nIt is a must to withdraw the mind from objective physicalities, because a scattered mind has neither the strength nor the capacity to achieve anything. When the mind is withdrawn from the objective physicality, it remains within the limits of the body, but even then it has not been withdrawn totally. It is still scattered throughout all parts of the body. Hence, it first has to be withdrawn from the body by concentrating it in a point.\n\nThis giving of a point is a most essential factor, because when the mind gets concentrated in a point it gains in strength and power. Secondly, the point must be in that part of the body which is dominated by the sentient force. This is simply because the static and mutative forces are the causes of restlessness, sleep and drowsiness, and the sentient force is the cause of stillness and peace. Hence the mind is given a point in the sentient part of the body on which to focus. This I-ness, once it has been seated at this point, is now to ideate on the Infinite Entity to convert itself into that. Therefore this most sublime idea is given to it.  \n\nThe withdrawal of mind from matter  from objective physicality  is known as bh칰ta sh칰ddhi (bh칰ta means 랁ive factors and sh칰ddhi means 랋urity). Bh칰ta sh칰ddhi means the withdrawal of the mind from the external vibrations of the five fundamental factors.  \nNext, the I-ness is systematically withdrawn from each portion of the body, then it is given a suitable point. This giving of the suitable point is known as 치sana sh칰ddhi. 츼sana sh칰ddhi means that the mind is situated at a pure seat. Just as a person makes a temple or mosque neat and clean and pure for worship, so the mind, in a natural way, is focused at the purest place wherefrom it can ideate on the Lord. Here it must be born in mind that the point which is given must touch the controlling nucleus of all three parts of the mind, viz. the conscious, the subconscious, and the unconscious, otherwise complete control of the mind will not be possible. This is simply because this point is the nucleus of the mind, and thus controls the mind just as the sun, as the nucleus of solar system, controls the solar system. So this controlling point must be taken into consideration.\n\nThe more people are able to withdraw, the more they will be able to link themselves into the domain of divine bliss. People often fail to withdraw or to take time to withdraw, and this is one of the vital reasons that they are not able to feel bliss in s치dhan치. So this withdrawal from objective physicality is known as mantra diipanii. A mantra is a holy word  one charged by a realized soul. Diipanii means 랇ight or 랎orch. So the withdrawal enlightens one뗩 mind and thereby aids in both mantra 치gh치t (repetition of the mantra) and mantra caetanya (ideation on the meaning of the mantra). The awareness of the mantra and the repeated forcing of the mantra uncoils the serpentine. A s치dhaka must, therefore, devote considerable time to withdrawal in order to master the successive steps of repetition and ideation. By doing more of the sh칰ddhis, the other techniques are greatly facilitated. Suppose a spiritualist practices meditation for half an hour. S/he ought to ideally spend at least fifteen minutes in withdrawal (the practical technique of withdrawal is taught personally by an 치c치rya of 츼nanda M치rga). This withdrawal, however, is not complete by fixing the mind in a suitable point alone; after this, one must also withdraw from the ideas and varieties of thoughts that are passing through the mind. To achieve this end the same technique is sufficient. Thus, withdrawal has three steps: withdrawal from the external world, the body, and the thoughts. Then comes mantra치gh치t and mantra caetanya.\n\nMantra치gh치t is of three kinds: Speaking loudly (which is known as v치canika in Sanskrit) is the first. Secondly, there is whispering where the words are not clearly audible. This is known as up치拷쯥hu in Sanskrit. The last and best kind of repetition is psychic repetition. This psychic repetition, however, does not come solely under the category of japakriya (repetitive incantation of mantra); rather it is in the category of Dh치ra켻치 (concentration) and dhy치na (ideational absorption in the Guru). This is because by repeating psychically one tries to establish parallelism between the word itself and its meaning. One wants to get into ideation of the mantra.\n\nThis kind of repetition at the suitable point (cakra) creates mantra치gh치t and is then followed by mantra caetanya, which is full awareness of the meaning of the mantra. If one does not include mantra caetanya, the mantra cannot be effective, and one is instead just like a parrot repeating words it cannot understand. This mantra caetanya of an I칦칤a Siddha Mantra is of vital importance. Hence it is rightly said in the Kularnava Tantra that a mantra without caetanya is nothing but a general word which cannot yield positive results. It is just like an ordinary word.\n\nThis mantra caetanya has two aspects: First the Sadguru has charged it with power. Secondly, it is taken with the awareness of its meaning. Therefore, mantra caetanya are collectively able to arouse kula ku켻d패alini (spiritual energy), the spiritual potential which normally resides in the lowest cakra or psychic centre. This spiritual potential, also known as the jiivabh치va (unit existence) or the force of fundamental negativity, is seated at the lowest part of the spine of every person and varies from individual to individual, depending on how much it has been awakened. This jiivabh치va, in some individuals, has come into close contact with the Infinite Cosmic Entity through spiritual practices and service; it has, therefore, taken on subtler and more subtler qualities. In other individuals their jiivabh치vas have different qualities because their ku켻d패alinis are unawakened. The ku켻d패alinis of all people are not one and the same. Now, the ku켻d패alini remains seated at the base of the spine. This base is known as the kula and the person who raises this ku켻d패alini from kula is known as Kulaguru. Kula generally means family, but here it does not mean family in the common sense. It is the base of the spine and the Sadguru can arouse it. Hence the Sadguru is also known as the Kulaguru: the preceptor who is able to arouse all ku켻d패alinis.\n\nIishvara Pra켻idh치na, however, is not finished here. It also includes within itself the moral principles (Yama and Niyama) and psycho-physical yoga exercises known as 치sanas. Following the moral guidelines helps one in the withdrawal of the mind; otherwise one may suffer from guilty conscience and his/her withdrawal will be disturbed by the subsequently imbalanced state of the mind. Yama and Niyama or the cardinal moral principles are the base for spiritual practices, and spiritual progress in turn helps to raise the ku쒞사linii which thereby strengthens the moral code. So morality and spiritual practice are interdependent. Morality, however, is just the base and not the end.\n\n츼sanas are also included in the first lesson. These yogic 치sanas are not just ordinary exercises; rather they are subtler in their effects, and they influence the mental state as well as the physical state due to their effects on the glands. Analyzing the different psychic tendencies of human beings, different 치sanas are then prescribed. Seeing the particular posture and benefit, the particular name of the 치sana has been given.\n\nMayur치sana (peacock pose) is done, for example, like a peacock. By doing this posture one can be able to digest even a snake like the peacock does, but this is not the reason for doing the pose. This 치sana helps a great deal in digestion, and any heaviness of the body or in the stomach can be removed by the practice of this 치sana.\n\nGomukh치sana is a posture where one assumes a shape similar to that of a cow뗩 head, so it is known as the 띾ow뗩 head posture. It brings about the kind of gentleness we generally find in a cow, and so like this with many of the 치sanas.\n\nAll the 치sanas have been researched by the seers and are a very vital part of Hatha Yoga. Generally the psychic exercises such as meditation cannot alone bring purity of both mind and body quickly of and by themselves. So 치sanas are given so that the glands and nerves are regulated and made balanced by their practice.\n\n츼sanas by themselves cannot give realization, because they remain confined to physicality and to some extent the psychic sphere: that is, 치sanas primarily purify the Annamaya Ko콑a. This Annamaya Ko콑a or physical body is susceptible to impurity, i.e. dominance by mutative and static principles. 츼sanas regulate the secretions of the glands, and because of the balanced secretions of the glands the mind is not overpowered by the propensities (vrttis). Hence, for controlling the vrttis, 치sanas play a vital role. All physical postures are variations of one 치sana or another. There are innumerable 치sanas but in our system there are 40-50 main exercises that have been selected. As these 치sanas are not just crude exercises but subtle movements, there are certain rules prescribed so that one can derive the maximum benefit from them. In the absence of following these rules, however, one may invite harm or disease because they are so powerful in their effects. Moreover, to insure that they are practiced correctly, it is preferable for one to get personal instruction. The 치c치ryas of 츼nanda M치rga teach these 치sanas in the proper way free of cost. Body and mind may both be purified by meditation alone, but in that case it will takemuch longer and the aspirant may lose patience and leave the path.\n\nAlong with practicing 치sanas there is also a need for a sentient diet, i.e. vegetarian food, as it has a definite effect on the formation of both the physical and mental bodies. Therefore, without being vegetarian it is not good to practice 치sanas except for just a few specific ones taught by the 치c치rya.\n\nThe first lesson, if done precisely, can lead a person to Savikalpa Sam치dhi. Here one feels oneness with the Cosmic Mind and experiences divine bliss. All the fetters (hatred, doubt, fear, shame, censure, sense of family prestige, vanity of culture, and false sense of prestige) and the six enemies (desire/passion, anger, greed, attachment, vanity/pride, and backbiting/envy) of one뗩 mind are controlled. The culmination of the first lesson is the pinnacle of sentient force and under this sentient force all of the static and mutative forces remain controlled. As such they are not able to disturb the mind. It is difficult to describe in writing the state of mind of this attainment. In short, it can only be said that the mind is completely steeled, it remains internally unaffected, though externally it may seem to be affected. The first lesson can lead a person to Savikalpa Sam치dhi but the Sadguru then, for the sake of the disciple, keeps the door of occult powers closed. This is because if one exhibits those powers the exalted state of Nirvikalpa may get disturbed. In the first lesson of this Sahaja Yoga of Tantra which we have now discussed, the I콑t패a mantras have been given by Lord Kr콑켻a, Bhaerava (the son of Shiva) and by Lord Shiva Himself. Different mantras are given to different people according to their reactive momenta (Sa拷쯥k치ras; reactions to past actions stored in the mind). However, these matters are known specifically only to the 치c치ryas and it is thus prohibited to reveal them here.\n\n#### 2nd Lesson\n\nWe are supposed to do 1st Lessons at all times during the day. Women are even instructed to repeat the mantra as per the rhythm of their contractions when in labour. The reality is however, that when we move in society, we are affected by so many distractions and our mind falls and is trapped in crude levels of Consciousness. It is with this human frailty in mind that the 2nd Lesson was given in the form of a special mantra whereby one directly surrenders to the Sadguru. One then experiences the blessing of an elevated mind with which one can practice 1st Lesson throughout the rest of the day. Since our mind repeatedly falls, this mantra is to be recited before all events of the day such as leaving home, boarding a train, etc.. This sweetness that we find when we take this mantra and the sweet state of mind it engenders is known in the Upanishads as Madhuvidya.\n\nLet us briefly explore this lesson in the article below.\n\n**Understanding the Second Lesson of 츼nanda M치rga Sahaja Yoga  \n(BRAHMACARYA, GURU MANTRA, MADHUVIDYA)**  \nBy_Acarya Cidghanananda Avadhuta_\n\nIn this sphere of spiritual progress  츼tmamok콑artha拷 [For Self-realization렣  the mere thought of one뗩 mission will not suffice. Your work in pursuance of your mission will be considered your service, and when your service will be sanctified by Guru Mantra [Second Lesson], you will spiritually advance. But when it is a question of spiritual salvation, spiritual beatitude, there what you need is I콑t패a Mantra [First Lesson]. (Incantation and Human Progress, Subh치콑ita Sa拷쯚raha Part 24)\n\nThe first lesson of our Tantra Yoga teaches a person to realize what we really are. We do not realize how through the process of this Iishvara Pranidhana or First Lesson we are transcending lower states of Consciousness and merging in the bliss of the Ishta or Beloved Goal.\n\nThe second lesson teaches the person what the universe is. Now, we learn that at all times we should be doing First Lesson or repeating our Ista Mantra while merging in our Ista, not just when we are meditating. As Baba (affectionate name of Shrii Sarkar) says,\n\nThe main purpose of human beings coming here to this earth is to do spiritual practice. One is to render social service, one is to learn, one is to go through books, one is to help others, one is to do anything and everything just to encourage and accelerate the process of s치dhan치. S치dhan치 is the main theme of life. Whatever you do in the world, you should do it with a view to promote your s치dhan치 and help the s치dhan치 of others. Human beings come to earth to practise s치dhan치, to move closer to Iishvara, the Supreme Goal  to come closer to Parama Puru콑a [Supreme Consciousness]. Thus, the deeds of human beings will not be like the deeds of animals. Whatever human beings will do, they will do in such a manner that the progress in their s치dhan치 will go on accelerating. (The Human Body Is a Biological Machine)\n\nBaba specifically told Acarya Naginaji how even while riding a bicycle one is to adjust the flow of the Ista Mantra with the movement of one뗩 feet. Similarly, Baba explained to pregnant women how to merge their labour contractions with their mantra.  \nHowever, while sadhana is easy when our eyes are closed and we are alone, it seems impossible with eyes wide open and amidst society. We try at different times such as while on the bus to concentrate on our Ista Mantra of First Lesson but that concentration ends after someone뗩 noise on the bus distracts us.\n\nThen if we try to follow the Karma Yoga of Lord Krsna and meditate while fighting against injustice, sadhana becomes impossible even when we are not fighting. This is because fighting crude forces awakens crude forces within us and we become emotionally involved with the crude level of Consciousness of the exploiters. Seeking to escape the crude waves of a corrupt society, some try to escape to the Himalayas but find no escape there because they are not blessed by the Lord with union with Him so long as they reject His creation.\n\nSo what is the way out? This is the Second Lesson where one learns a new mantra called Guru Mantra. The Guru Mantra is a powerful mantra that reminds us of what this universe really is  what is the ultimate reality, the only REALITY. Furthermore the Guru Mantra is a direct link and surrender to Baba, the Paramestin Guru [Supreme Beloved Preceptor]. In First Lesson, Baba graces our sadhana and when we want to go deeper than merger in Cosmic Consciousness. This means going deeper into the realm of pure love then we come in direct contact with Him and begin to merge with Him by the Guru Mantra.\n\nHowever in Second Lesson we are coming in direct contact with Him by our surrender through the Guru Mantra. The meaning of the mantra is the way in which we surrender our mind (agitated by social life) unto Him. As Baba explains,\n\n\u003e So Tattvabh치v치t  that is, 랊ne is to establish one뗩 mind in the idea of Thatness. Whatever I see,(15) everything is That; everything is Parama Puru콑a. By constant meditation, by constant repetition of your Guru Mantra  [what you learned in your] Second Lesson [you perform] Tattvabh치v치t. [Ascribing] Brahma-hood to each and every entity is Tattvabh치v치t.\n\u003e \n\u003e -The Causal Matrix, Subh치콑ita Sa拷쯚raha Part 24\n\nReally speaking, all meditation (of any lesson begins with the essential spirit and ambience of second lesson and all meditation ends in second lesson. This is why senior meditators like Didi Ananda Bharati used to teach people Second Lesson by giving them a bowl of seeds and ask them to place each seed in another bowl. This way people learned to take Guru Mantra with each seed and the spiritual effects on one뗩 moment-to-moment Consciousness are tremendous. In the Guru Giita, it is said,\n\n_Gurumantro mukhe yasya tasya siddhayanti n치nyath치 (131)_  \n[The one who always has Guru Mantra in their mouth  \nThey alone attain success (in all actions);  \nThey alone attain perfection (siddha)  \nNone other than they.]\n\nThere are two paths of repeating the Guru Mantra. Firstly there is the yogic path where one is ideating on the meaning of the mantra and is blessed by the Guru with the realization of one Consciousness pervading all beings. Secondly there is the devotional path where one uses the mantra to call out of the Beloved (Baba) out of yearning to experience Him in all beings, at all times. This takes the form of first the realization of Baba in everything (jinana yoga or union through wisdom). Second, there is the experience of Baba in every stage of one뗩 service work to liberate humanity from divisive sentiments and capitalist exploitation (karma yoga or union through service and revolutionary fight). Third, there is the raptures of divine love and intimacy or prema. So a devotee wants to love Him, unite with Him in everything and with this spirit repeats their Guru Mantra before every action.\n\nThere are three basic realities we experience that are discussed in the tradition of Shiva that is the foundation upon which Baba erected His mission. The first reality is what is called K콑ara (pronounced 랆shara) Brahma. This is worldly consciousness characterized by K콑ara which means 띿ecaying, ever-changing, metamorphosed. This is because we perceive many objects and none of them lasts. Some keep running after newer and newer objects being created and some mourn the loss of objects and beings that eternally become lost. Both are a kind of materialism. One is a positive materialism and the other is a negative materialism or nihilism that denies the existence or reality or meaning of one or more of these objects and beings.\n\nIn our daily lives we are constantly going through such stages of materialism and nihilism in our reactions to people, places and things. All of these are what Baba calls psycho-physical parallelism which simply means that our mind waves are merging with those of matter. Even the so-called nihilists are merging their mind with the psychological idea of nothingness. To escape this path, meditation is the only answer. The simplest way to get cured of all psychic ailments is to use Guru Mantra while performing every action, every mundane duty. Baba explains how Guru Mantra can liberate us from the negativity of nihilism as follows,\n\n\u003e Sarvan치sha causes people to think, I have nothing of my own. Everything is gone. I am undone. Such a negative outlook can only be cured with the constant auto-suggestion, Parama Puru콑a is mine, which in the language of Tantra is called Guru Mantra. The feeling that one is defeated in life is ra-biij치tmak [symbolized by the letter ra], and its cure is the auto-suggestion that I have come to win. I am destined to win. People of developed mentality try to keep the minds of people of such negative outlook free from the unhealthy effect of that mentality by outer-suggestion. To do this is the duty of each and every good person. We should see that our fellow human beings are never allowed to throw themselves into the abyss of frustration and disappointment; they should be rescued before they jump.\n\u003e \n\u003e -The Acoustic Roots of the Indo-Aryan Alphabet\n\nThe second reality of the meditator is Ak콑ara Brahma. This is the eternal Consciousness we experience as underlying the changing realities of the universe. In actual fact the Macrocosm or Cosmic Mind transforms a part of itself into the K콑ara Brahma or worldly consciousness of infinite objects. That portion of the Macrocosm that is not transformed into worldly consciousness is known as Ak콑ara Brahma. Ak콑ara means 랄mmortal, undecaying, undergoing no metamorphosis. This immutable Consciousness is known as Cosmic Consciousness. It is a feeling of infinite vastness or Mahat in Sanskrit. This is the realization of the yogi in First Lesson and Second Lesson. This Ak콑ara Brahma is the Cosmic Knower or Cosmic I (feeling that I exist). This is the experience that yogis attain in First Lesson and are blessed with in Second Lesson. When one becomes lost in this state it is called Savikalpa Samadhi or the Determinate Trance of Absorption in Consciousness. Baba has described this bliss as follows,\n\n\u003e When a s치dhaka realizes: My hands, feet, in fact all my Indriyas [sensory and motor organs] are not actually mine. I am an Infinite Entity. Of what good are they to me? My characteristic Self, my Citishakti (the force of consciousness) is incomprehensible beyond the scope of imagination. All the sensible and perceptible objects, the sense of sight, the sense of hearing are all ensconced in my mental sphere. Of what use are those eyes and ears to me? I see without my eyes. I hear without my ears. I am aware of the variegated rise and fall of every wave, every movement of this creation. I am the knower of each and every object, crude, subtle, causal. I am concerned with all. But no one knows me and no one is my subject, nor am I the object of anyone. I am the pure Consciousness. No other mind can hold me in its thought.\n\u003e \n\u003e -The Intuitional Science of the Vedas  4\n\nHowever this state of Consciousness is not the ultimate state. This is because this state of Knowership is intimately involved with the perishable world of infinite objects that is experienced by people in a crude state of Consciousness. The third form of Consciousness is Nirak콑ara Brahma. This is the Saviour Consciousness or Taraka Brahma. That ultimate entity who completely transcends or is beyond the worldly consciousness and the Knower Consciousness and at the same is utterly pervading and controlling these two levels of Consciousness is called Nirak콑ara Brahma. This is the Transcendent Consciousness that is beyond all speech and beyond the cosmos and the Cosmic Mind. It is realized only by love  not by yoga or by philosophy.\n\nPure devotees attain this Transcendent Consciousness in First Lesson but that is difficult for yogi what to mention ordinary people. Here is the unique specialty of Second Lesson. By reciting this Guru Mantra we are making a direct appeal to Him before each of our actions. Those who do this will feel His presence before every action after reciting the Guru Mantra. Then this Transcendent Consciousness will become a practical reality.\n\nThere are some sadhakas who spend much less time with First Lesson and instead concentrate on loving Baba in Dhyana or Sixth Lesson. So what is the relevance of Second Lesson for them? Firstly it should be clear that Dhyana involves firstly running after Baba no matter how He hides. Second it involves ideating that one is performing physical service to Him as part of the process of meditation. Thirdly it involves the ideological process of absorbing everything (all the radiance, love, tenderness, orders, visions, etc) that He reveals during Dhyana and then after meditation reflecting on all this, learning from it and then bringing all of this into one뗩 actions in the society. Fourthly it involves dedicating one뗩 existence to giving Him love.\n\nNow in daily life, many times our mind is partly running after Baba but most of the time it is not, even when He is blessing us with the bliss of seeing Him while we are walking, talking etc. Here Guru Mantra is crucial as it reminds us that He is everywhere waiting for us to play with Him. This entire universe is His play and we are bound to chase after Him to embrace Him. Second even when in daily life we are seeing Baba, we are being blessed but we are not even trying to serve Baba in any way. This is why taking Guru Mantra before every action reminds us that we live to give Him service. When we ideate that we are Baba뗩 PA or His Mother/Father and take full physical care of Him then alone do we understand what is the reality of Dhyana. Only then in such a state do we have a chance to do real, meaningful service of Him in countless people, places and things. Many times after getting bh치va or devotional ecstasy, that bliss automatically fills our thoughts, feelings and actions afterwards.\n\nBut this does not last long and more importantly much of this ecstasy is wasted because we are not really grateful for it and are not using it to serve others as part of establishing His ideology. This is another key aspect of Guru Mantra  that we say it before every action so as to remind ourselves to bring His bliss into our actions and so that we can realize Him in the people we exist only to serve.\n\nFinally, many people enjoy Dhyana like devotional parasites and never really try to give Baba bliss. Baba says a gopa/gopi is someone who has the power to give real bliss. We know what it is like when we are blissed out  tears fill our eyes, our throats are choked, our hairs stand on end, our hearts throb with rapture. We are not here to enjoy His love like this. We are here to use the blissful love He gives us to give Him love. Saying Guru Mantra before every action reminds us that He is everywhere, within everything  waiting for our Union.\n\nBaba explains how this liberates us from the cycle of karma. When we act with ego consciousness it generates a reaction which is stored in the mind. These reactions cause us to remain bound to move from life to life in order to exhaust or fully express these reactions. However in every new life we act with ego consciousness which leads us to have more reactions stored in our minds. Hence we seem to be trapped for eternity in the cycle of births and deaths. Guru Mantra is the way out.\n\n\u003e If people become more and more regular in the application of their guru mantra, then on one hand they will be able to perform more and more physical activities, and at the same time they will be able to avoid creating new sa拷쯥k치ras (reactive momenta).\n\u003e \n\u003e -Parama Puru콑a and His Creation, Subh치콑ita Sa拷쯚raha Part 10\n\nHowever, mere recitation of the Guru Mantra is not enough. One must fully charge one뗩 mind with the ideation of the meaning and the state of Consciousness of the mantra. The process of working, serving and fighting in the external world while ideating that everything is that Taraka Brahma or Beloved is known as madhuvidya or honey-knowledge. Vidya means not just knowledge in the sense of information or principles of some subject. Vidya here means a means of establishing oneself in absolute Knowledge beyond all limited knowledge of worldly consciousness. Baba said that Guru Mantra is the key to realizing madhuvidya in the practical world. Baba explains this yoga saying,\n\n\u003e Suppose, there is a drop of water in an ocean. When the drop feels its unity with the ocean, the drop no longer remains as a drop, it becomes the ocean. But when it feels its separation from the ocean, it is nothing but a drop of water. So, when a human being feels his/her unity with the Supreme Lord and feels that he/she is not an ordinary person, but the blessed child of the Supreme Father and when becomes one with him, then he/she is no longer an ordinary person. He/she acquires immense power, immense vitality, infinite vitality and this is your Yoga in the physical sphere. You should always remember that a man or a woman is an ordinary person when separated from the Supreme Father, but he/she becomes Supreme when one with the Supreme. This we do with the help of our Guru Mantra. This is Yoga in the physical sphere.\n\u003e \n\u003e -What Is Yoga?, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 14\n\nSo such a practice of Guru Mantra alone gives us the power to defeat global capitalist exploitation, to elevate the collective mind and to flood the world with devotional love. Baba explains how this madhuvidya drenches our life with His sweetness, saying,\n\n\u003e When we fondle a little child, we think that the child is not merely a child, but rather Parama Puru콑a Himself has come to me in the form of a child just to enjoy my fondling, love, and care. He has willingly come to me for that purpose. This is called madhuvidy치, and one should always remember to do it. And one who remembers to do it all the time is considered a great person in society.\n\u003e \n\u003e The Omnipotent and Omnipresent Consciousness\n\nSo many times service workers become corrupted by the hardships they face. Baba explains how this mantra blesses our service saying,\n\n\u003e In this sphere of spiritual progress  츼tmamok콑artha拷 [For Self-realization렣  the mere thought of one뗩 mission will not suffice. Your work in pursuance of your mission will be considered your service, and when your service will be sanctified by Guru Mantra, you will spiritually advance.\n\u003e \n\u003e -Incantation and Human Progress, Subh치콑ita Sa拷쯚raha Part 24\n\nHowever, we are bound to wonder how does such a sweet devotional practice of Guru Mantra give us the power to establish sublime righteousness (Dharma) in the society? In reality, when we follow a materialistic lifestyle we are following the path of worldly consciousness that leads us ultimately to the path of unrighteousness, corruption, vice and exploitation (Adharma). Guru Mantra saves us from this fate as Baba explains,\n\n\u003e All dharmas [animal, plant, human] have upadharmas [secondary characteristics]. Human life is no exception. For example, to provide for your family you require some sort of employment  be it agriculture, trading or business  you have to keep the house clean, feed everyone, and so on. These are the secondary characteristics included within the Fundamental Human Dharma. What normally happens in human life? People get caught up in the secondary characteristics. For instance, when eating delicious food people often say How good it tastes! But if it only had a bit more spice in it, then it would taste even better. Being engrossed in the secondary dharma, people all too easily deviate from their main dharma.  \n\u003e In Ananda Marga there is a system of applying Guru Mantra before commencing any action. The psycho-philosophy behind Guru Mantra is to transform the secondary dharma into the primary dharma at the psychic level. If this were not done then one뗩 secondary dharma would predominate. Much precious time is wasted by those who follow their secondary dharmas.  \n\u003e P치rthas치rathi Kr콑켻a exhorted the people unambiguously: Give up secondary dharmas and accept Me as your supreme goal. Do not let your mind be diverted to those countless secondary dharmas, but concentrate it on the fundamental primary dharma. Only then will every moment of your life be properly utilized. Now, what is this primary dharma? P치rthas치rathi declared, M치meka拷 shara켻a拷 vraja [랎ake shelter in Me alone렣. Earlier I said that vraja means to move with Cosmic ideation in a state of bliss.\n\u003e \n\u003e -Nam치mi Kr콑켻asundaram Discourse 18\n\nAnd this primal Dharma of taking shelter in the Beloved (Baba) is the essence of Second Lesson. What is the result of pursuing this path of Dharma?\n\nWhen one no longer makes such a mistake, that is, when one always remembers to use Guru Mantra before starting any activity, one is said to have attained 띿hruva smrti or 랁ixed memory. Dhruva means 랁ixed, 랍tationary. When, by dint of s치dhan치, one establishes oneself in Dhruva Smrti, one experiences an unbroken flow of bliss in one뗩 mind. In the scriptures, this intense spiritual bliss is termed 띿harma megh치nanda. Whenever you develop that sort of fixed memory, you will experience dharma megh치nand치. (ㄹn Exemplary Life, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 7)\n\nWe can understand in theory this blissful trance but the question arises exactly how Guru Mantra is related to the practical aspect of Dharma or morality. We can remember that morality has 10 principles of which 5 are psycho-physical emanations or endeavours to direct our mind to control our physical actions and to infuse them with blissful ideation. These principles are called Yama. Baba explains how Guru Mantra is related to the key principle of Yama or Brahmacarya saying,\n\n\u003e Brahmacaryam  that is 랈oving in Brahma while eating. What sort of eating? The person is getting all sorts of physical, psychic and supra-psychic pabula from the Cosmic Body of Brahma. Thus he or she who is moving in Brahma with the help of her/his second lesson, Guru Mantra, is brahmac치rii. He always remembers the fact that all his movements are within the Cosmic Body of Brahma.\n\u003e \n\u003e -The Glory of Pra켻ava, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 1\n\nAs we all know this moral principle is very difficult if not impossible. This is because as Baba says,\n\n\u003e It is only when one is free from all the extroversial tendencies, the 콑ad패ripu and a콑t패ap치sha, collectively known as Avidy치m치y치, that one뗩 mind can become Brahmac치rii. The dominance of avidy치 (extroversial tendencies) is so strong that it is not possible to overcome it except through intuitional practice. Those who try to attain Brahmacarya without performing intuitional practice are wasting their time. Intuitional practice will by itself gradually divert the mind from crude to subtle, and a person will slowly become Brahmac치rii. The domination of the 콑ad패ripu and the a콑t패ap치sha, the extroversial tendencies, will diminish by itself. With the disappearance of their influence the mind will no longer remain absorbed in crudeness.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Why Are People Afraid of Intuitional Practice?\n\nThe 콑ad패ripu or six enemies are the dominant internal propensities of the mind firstly k치ma (physical desires), krodha (anger), lobha (greed). From these emerge the other three ripus of mada (vanity), moha (blind attachment), and m치tsarya (jealousy).\n\nThe a콑t패ap치sha or eight bondages are what we learn from the society and which are associated with one or more of the internal enemies or ripus. They are lajj치 (shame), bhaya (fear), ghr켻치 (hatred), shau攷긂치 (doubt), kula (pride in family status), shiila (cultural superiority complex), m치na (vanity) and jugups치 (hypocrisy and backbiting).\n\nSo what do these vices have to do with Guru Mantra and with Dharma? Firstly various narrow sentiments such as religious sentiment, caste sentiment, economic class sentiment, national sentiment are all based on these debased states of mind. And it is these narrow sentiments which are used by exploiters to keep the poor people divided so they can be easily exploited. Hence to establish the rule of righteousness (Dharma-rajya) demands the transcendence of these states of mind. It is Guru Mantra that gives us the Grace of Baba that alone enables us to transcend these debased states of mind and gives us the capacity to become the medium by which He liberates the collective mind from these narrow sentiments and the crude forms of Consciousness underlying them.\n\nBaba explains how the negativity that cripples our mind is removed by this practice saying,\n\n\u003e Sarvan치sha [a mental propensity or vrtti] causes people to think, I have nothing of my own. Everything is gone. I am undone. Such a negative outlook can only be cured with the constant auto-suggestion, Parama Puru콑a is mine, which in the language of Tantra is called Guru Mantra.\n\u003e \n\u003e -The Acoustic Roots of the Indo-Aryan Alphabet, Discourses on Tantra Volume One\n\nOnly then can one move and live while absorbed in Pure Consciousness or be established in Brahmacarya. However, Brahmacarya is impossible unless the other four principles of Yama are emanating from one뗩 mind. For morality is not forcing the mind to follow a rule. Rather morality is a state where the mind is balanced and in a dynamic flow towards merger in Consciousness. The other four emanations and forms of moral meditation are Ahimsa (not harming anyone by thought, word or deed), Satya (the use of mind and speech to bring about the welfare of everyone), Asteya (not depriving others of what is their due by thought, word or deed) and Aparigraha (not possessing and enjoying any physical object more than is necessary to preserve one뗩 life). To put this very briefly we can see that the roots of exploitation, injustice and immorality lie in the failure to observe these principles.  \nUltimately we realize that without a transcendence of our material consciousness, we cannot be internally established in these principles. This transcendence of Consciousness is Brahamcarya where we experience Consciousness in all our actions. And this Brahmacarya is attained by our Guru Mantra.\n\nHence without morality or the principles of Yama we cannot practice Second Lesson or Guru Mantra. And it is due to this that so many yogis have fallen from the path so many times.\n\nEven First Lesson is dependent on morality. How is this so? Because Iishvara Pranidhana or First Lesson is itself a principle of morality. It is one of the 5 Niyamas which are physico-psychic movements or introversive moral practices by which we move from the physical world to the spiritual world. However this principle of Iishvara Pranidhana cannot be practiced unless one is established in the other 4 Niyamas, namely, Shaoca (social, bodily and internal purity), Santo콑a (mental equanimity or contentment with what physical or psychic objects one possession and with worldly failures and sorrows), Tapah (sacrifices, suffering willingly, blissfully undergone in order to help others, remove their suffering or exploitation and establish Sadvipra Samaja or rule of spiritual revolutionaries) and Sv치dhy치ya (study of one뗩 true Self or Atman or Unit Consciousness through studying the teachings of enlightened saints and of Taraka Brahma). All of these principles involve moral struggle and Tapah by its very nature involves social struggle.\n\nWe see clearly that Iishvara Pranidhana is dependent on moral principles of Niyama. Furthermore it is impossible to practice these principles of Niyama if one is not established in Pure Consciousness or Brahmacarya or Yama. And this is not possible without the practice of Second Lesson. Hence Yama and Niyama are interlinked eternally and so are the First Lesson and Second Lesson of Ananda Marga Sadhana. The practice of Second Lesson establishes one in the struggle for righteousness or Dharma  that is both internal and external. Hence it is crystal clear that unless one is engaged in the struggle to establish a Dharmic society, one cannot become truly established in First Lesson or Second Lesson.\n\nHence we can now understand why Baba says in His Supreme Command,\n\n\u003e Without Yama and Niyama, Sadhana [spiritual practice] is an impossibility. Hence the Lord뗩 Command is also to follow Yama and Niyama. Disobedience to this command is nothing but to throw oneself into the tortures of animal life for crores of years.\n\nBaba explains the blissful state that results saying,\n\n\u003e You should remember to use Guru Mantra regularly before every action. One attains success in the field of action by the right application of Guru Mantra. Some of you, I do not say all, often forget to use guru mantra before starting an activity. If you do forget, repeat it after completing the action. When one no longer makes such a mistake, that is, when one always remembers to use guru mantra before starting any activity, one is said to have attained 띿hruva smrti or 랁ixed memory. Dhruva means 랁ixed, 랍tationary. When, by dint of s치dhan치, one establishes oneself in dhruva smrti, one experiences an unbroken flow of bliss in one뗩 mind. In the scriptures, this intense spiritual bliss is termed 띿harma megh치nanda. Whenever you develop that sort of fixed memory, you will experience dharma megh치nand치.\n\u003e \n\u003e -An Exemplary Life, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 7\n\nHowever we are not merely to practice Yama and Niyama on the individual level. We are bound to practice it on the collective level as well. A society where people are moving together, sharing together and fighting together to become collectively established in Yama and Niyama is a genuine society. All other society are by very definition immoral or Adharmic. This is because where there is not moral struggle immorality is sure to blossom from the roots of selfishness sprouting from the seeds of crude Consciousness. And we can now realize what it is a part and parcel of our Sadhana to lead others along the path of Dharma or righteousness. This leading by serving, this purifying our collective family, this fighting for peace based on justice and this dedication to a love revolution in all hearts is the real spiritual practice. For this one requires the constant blessing of the Supreme Beloved at all times. And this is why Second Lesson was given unto us. And this process of moving towards Dharma is the essence of our Second Lesson. By this Second Lesson we will not just given the bliss of Dharma to others we will surrender to Him and love Him in everyone and everything by our Guru Mantra and lead others along this path of utter love.  \nFor the blessing of learning this lesson with this mission may our minds fall at His Feet again and again for so long as we may live.\n\n#### Sh치kta\n\nWhat is the spirit of the mind of a pashu who is empowered by Tantra meditation. Such a sadhaka always seeks to rouse courage and determination in their minds. When empowered by divine energy (Shakti) they become powerful personalities or shaktas. As Shrii Sarkar explains,\n\n\u003e Who is a Sh치kta? A Sh치kta is one who is determined to awaken his or her cognitive faculty and fight against the negative influence of the static principle. Such a person struggles ceaselessly against psychic impurities and physical ailments in individual life, and against social evils and economic disparity in collective life. A Sh치kta is not afraid of the crushing load of unhappiness in life, and never surrenders to pessimism, but fights against the miseries of life with revolutionary zeal. This is the criterion of a Sh치kta. Such dauntless fighting spirit wins the laurels of victory for a Sh치kta one day, a victory which is never possible through coaxing and cajoling. Of course, as a war strategy, there can be a temporary truce, but nothing more than that  \n\u003e The requital of reactive momenta is felt most acutely in the Sh치kta stage, because this stage involves a tremendous fight against Prakrti.  \n\u003e The Sh치kta stage is dominated by ji攷치na and karma, not by bhakti.(5) Wherever there is struggle, action is bound to become predominant; likewise one will have to acquire knowledge  the knowledge of how to struggle. Through knowledge, Sh치kta s치dhakas become fully aware that all their sorrows and afflictions are the results of their past original actions. In order to be relieved of their affliction they do not cry pitifully to Parama Puru콑a, but, displaying the spirit of valour, say, O Parama Puru콑a, give me strength to continue the struggle. I do not want to escape from affliction and suffering, I want to attain You in a joyful struggle against the affliction and suffering. The great poet Rabindranath Tagore said in this regard,  \n\u003e _Vipade more rak콑치 kara e nahe mor pr치rthan치,  \n\u003e Vipade yena n치 kari kabhu bhay;  \n\u003e Duhkha t치pe vyathita cite n치i b치 dile s치ntvan치  \n\u003e Duhkhe yena karite p치ri jay._  \n\u003e [My prayer to You is not Save me from danger, but Bless me so that I can overcome danger. You need not console me in my suffering, but bless me so that I can overcome suffering.]  \n\u003e This is the underlying spirit of a Sh치kta.\n\u003e \n\u003e -S치dhan치, Subh치콑ita Sa拷쯚raha Part 7\n\n#### Acquiring Knowledge\n\nKnowledge for the pashus is primarily mundane knowledge attained by general research. Even this knowledge of pure research striving to find the truth is not taught anywhere. Why? Shrii Sarkar bluntly says,\n\n\u003e The system of education prevailing today was formulated or evolved long ago, mainly with a view to suit the needs of the capitalist class. For the last three to four thousand years, the same type of education is being imparted. The main purpose behind this sort of educational system is to create persons with slavish mentality: this sort of education is fundamentally defective.  \n\u003e A new educational system must evolve to produce sadvipras: we have to thoroughly revamp the entire educational system. But it must be remembered that unless and until a new system is developed, we cannot demolish the old one, in spite of our aversion to it. Until you catch hold of a new branch, you cannot let go of the previous one. But it is certain that this type of education which serves the capitalists interests is not at all suitable. This sort of education creates obstacles in the evolution of humanity.\n\u003e \n\u003e -Taking the Opposite Stance in Battle, Subh치콑ita Sa拷쯚raha Part 10\n\nShrii Sarkar explains the first stage of knowledge thus:\n\n\u003e The process of acquiring knowledge, a process divided into three stages: ava-치tmasthiiks치ra켻a, upa-치tmasthiikara켻a, and samyak-치tmasthiik치ra켻a.  \n\u003e In the first stage (ava-치tmasthiikara켻) you form a rough idea about an object in the external world, but do not try to enter its psychic sphere. This is the normal process regarding most objects. You may say, This species of palmyra grows in abundance in northern India. It has such and such characteristics. But this species of palmyra is common to southern India. It looks quite different from its northern cousin. So in the process of ava-치tmasthiikara켻a (superficial assimilation of projection) we study the external characteristics of an object.  \n\u003e If someone asks you, you can easily give a description of different species of palmyra, but you will not be able to go any deeper because you have not entered its psychic sphere. From external observation you can determine the nature of a person, but without penetrating his psychic sphere you will be unable to tell whether he is truly good, or merely a wicked person in the guise of a good man.  \n\u003e Penetrating the psychic sphere can be done in two ways: through applied psychology and through Cosmic Grace. When you attain the quality of macrocosmic omniscience, by His grace, your mind can easily enter the minds of others.  \n\u003e Most people can reach the stage of superficial psychic assimilation. With this superficial knowledge the pandits debate amongst themselves, scholars write theses, and groups of intellectuals repudiate each others arguments. Strangely, many so called intellectuals have grossly inflated egos even though they have only attained this superficial knowledge. Actually they know so little.  \n\u003e 츼tmaji攷치na拷 vidurji攷치na拷 ji攷치n치nyany치ni y치nitu;  \n\u003e T치ni ji攷치n치vabh치s치ni s치rasyanaeva bodhan치t.  \n\u003e Internal knowledge, that is self knowledge, and not the knowledge of the intellect, is the real knowledge. Other knowledge is merely the shadow of knowledge. Through intellectual knowledge one cannot attain anything. No matter how learned people might be in this world, they are all throwing mud in the realm of superficial psychic assimilation. They remain ignorant of the reality behind each object. This sort of superficial psychic assimilation takes place due to study, intellection cultivation, direct perception, inference, testimony and authority.  \n\u003e Perception takes place when the sensory organs assimilate external objects. It뗩 accuracy depends on the degree of assimilation. If our eyes are defective, for example, perception through them also becomes defective. If one glances hastily at tomato seeds, brinjal seeds and chilli seeds, one may mistake one for the other. So perception is not always a reliable source of information.  \n\u003e The second source of knowledge is inference, which is even more unreliable in conveying information from the external world. In winter smoke rises from many sources. Suppose water is suddenly converted into vapour, it appears as if smoke is rising. If you take that vapour to be smoke you are wrong. Thus inference is not a reliable source of knowledge. Suppose you see smoke coming out of a thatched hut. You may conclude that the hut is on fire, but on further investigation will realize that the family is lighting the oven. So through inference one cannot arrive at a safe conclusion.  \n\u003e The next source of knowledge is authority (치gama). People normally accept the words of a teacher or the printed words as being factually correct. When someone points out that some of the informations printed in a particular book are wrong common people will refuse to believe it, because for them the printed word is sacred. I read in one page of Nam치mi Kr콑켻asundara拷, Suniilakomalacchavi拷. According to Sa拷쯥krta spelling it should 랇ak콑abim, but has been wrongly printed as 랇acchavi拷. Ordinary people will say that they have seen it spelled that way in a book so how can it be wrong? Thus authority is not a reliable source of knowledge. So superficial psychic assimilation of external objects through direct perception, inference or authority is very unreliable.\n\u003e \n\u003e -Ekendriya  2, Ananda Marga Philosophy in a Nutshell Part 6\n\n#### S치m치ny치 Bhakti\n\nThe word 락hakti means to 랑orship and 랎o praise with love. It also refers to the longing of mystical love. When our love and longing is focused upon our innermost Beloved and none else this is known as bhakti. There are various levels of bhakti from the more selfish to the utterly self-effacing. These levels of bhakti are related to different samadhis (trances of absorption in Consciousness) that are experienced when one purifies and surrenders oneself at different cakras [spiritual centres along the spine related to various glands and sub-glands.]. The process by which one realises these different levels of bhakti is known as bhakti yoga. This bhakti yoga is not solely an internal affair. Rather one뗩 entire external and social life become drenched in the nectar of bhakti. Bhakti gives tremendous power to move and elevate the hearts of the common people. This is why bhakti is crucial for a Sadvipra or spiritual leader.\n\nThe primeval form of bhakti is associated with reverence and is the basis of spirituality in animistic communities.\n\n\u003e When an individual뗩 psychic feelings get suspended at the sight of the greatness of an entity, then the individual attitude towards that great entity is devotion. Initially it is known as s치m치ny치 bhakti [natural devotion]. This s치m치nya bhakti is present even in many undeveloped creatures. Suppose you look upon the vast Himalayan range. When you gaze at the sky-kissing peaks, your mind becomes overwhelmed and you exclaim, Oh, how vast are these mountains! You develop a feeling of reverence for the Himalayas.  \n\u003e In ancient times, whenever people looked upon anything very great, whether crude, subtle or causal, they began to worship it out of a feeling of reverence. If people worship many things then the mind will naturally flow in many directions; rather the mind should be made to flow towards the greatest of the great entities. That Entity alone should be the object of bhakti.\n\u003e \n\u003e -Discourse 23, Nam치mi Kr콑켻asundaram\n\nThis reverential bhakti can be of three categories  T치masika (crude, static), R치jasika (mutative, crudely passionate, incessantly moving) and S치ttvika. T치masika bhakti involves prayers to the Lord to punish or kill one뗩 enemies. R치jasika bhakti involves prayers for material objects or for fame, power, etc.. S치ttvika bhakti involves prayers to be liberated from life뗩 sorrows and to gain mukti (liberation) or moksa (salvation). All these are selfish forms of devotion.\n\n#### Dash치\n\nAs the kundalinii or spiritual energy at the base of the spine advance up the spinal column it transcends the bondages of the binding fetter of the Creative Principle (Shakti). The first such stage is known as Dash치.\n\n\u003e When the bondage of the static principle disappears, the aspirant enjoys a particular nature of bliss. There, that is, in that stage, there remains no static bondage, but the bondages of the mutative and sentient principle are there. Then the bondage of the mutative principle disappears. And finally, when the bondage of the sentient principle disappears, man becomes one with his object of ideation.  \n\u003e Now when, in the primordial phase, after starting in the physical sphere, the aspirant is just about to cross the cordon of the static principle, he enjoys a special nature of pleasure. We may say 랋leasure, because it is not the supreme beatitude, but is a modified form of beatitude. Not purely pleasure, something higher, something subtler, something more charming, more beautiful  more than pleasure. That enjoyment, that psycho-spiritual enjoyment, is known as dash치 in Sanskrit.  \n\u003e In the dash치 phase, the aspirant enjoys a sort of inner pleasure, but his sensory and motor organs fail to express it. Even language is too weak to convey the experience. That stage of the human mind is called dash치. The mind tries to express something but the vocal cord cannot produce the appropriate sound. In that stage the aspirant may create a sound like o攷 . . . o攷 . . . o攷, like this, but no definite language is produced.  \n\u003e Just when the aspirant crosses the cordon of the supreme static point, just on the other side, he feels another type of pleasure, and in that case (it is a subtler phase) he feels that he is with his Goal, he is with the Supreme Entity. The Universe is also there, but he feels that he has become a strong person  physically, mentally, spiritually  and under such circumstances, he does not care a fig for what the world says. This phase is called bh치va. When a man is in bh치va, it will be very easy for you to know it, because there will be a certain expression, not in the vocal cord, but from here [taps the an치hata cakra]. Perhaps you have seen someone saying B치b치! B치b치!  saying like this. Have you seen it? Because the expression comes from this point [indicates an치hata cakra again].\n\u003e \n\u003e -You Should Do Accordingly, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 12\n\nWhen the s치dhaka clearly feels the thrill of divine existence around him at the time of s치dhan치, the state of bliss as experienced by the s치dhaka is described as dash치뵈t the time of dash치, the s치dhaka feels bliss within and falls down.\n\n#### R치g치nuga Bhakti\n\nWhen the kundalinii rises above the lowest cakra (m칰l치dh치ra) at the based of the spine, thereafter their unfolds various forms of pure, unqualified (nirguna) bhakti. The first type of bhakti that evolves in the next 3 cakras is R치g치nuga Bhakti. As Shrii Sarkar explains,\n\n\u003e In the cult of devotion, a higher [form of s치dhan치 is] r치g치nuga bhakti. The word r치g치 is derived from the word ra켻j + ghai攷 suffix. The verb ra켻j means 랎o colour. R치g치nuga bhakti means that type of devotion which gives expression to one뗩 inner devotion. The psychology behind this type of bhakti is, Because of my r치g치nuga bhakti, because I have dyed my mind with His colour, He will be pleased. And when He is pleased, I will also get pleasure. Some people may think, Parama Puru콑a likes to eat malpoa [sweet], so let me prepare a few pieces of malpoa for Him. When He will eat malpoa He will feel pleasure, and when He feels pleasure, I will derive joy from His joy.\n\u003e \n\u003e -Spring Festival, A Few Problems Solved Part 5\n\n#### S치lokya Devotional Sam치dhi\n\nThe first form of R치g치nuga Bhakti is a blissful trance known as S치lokya Sam치dhi. Briefly, Shrii Sarkar explains its essence saying,\n\n\u003e Now when the s치dhaka by dint of his or her s치dhan치, intuitional practice, exalts that kulaku켻d패alinii, and when the kulaku켻d패alinii crosses the sv치dhi콑t패h치na cakra [pancreas along the spine], the next higher cakra, the s치dhaka뗩 feeling, his or her expression, his or her status, is known as s치lokya. It is the first stage of sam치dhi. A s치dhaka [spiritual aspirant by constant practice is sure to attain that status. But you know, the yogis say that a s치dhaka cannot attain that status without the special favour of the spiritual guru. This is what they say. That stage is called s치lokya.  \n\u003e S치lokya means that the s치dhaka feels that in the stratum, or sphere, where he or she is, where that person뗩 exalted mind is, he or she is not alone; the Supreme Father is also there. This sam치dhi, where the feeling is that in the stratum, or status, where the person is, that person뗩 Supreme Father is also there, gives the person very much pleasure. This first pleasure is called s치lokya sam치dhi.\n\u003e \n\u003e Stages of Samadhi, Discourses on Tantra 1\n\n#### Vraja Bh치va\n\nThe different forms of blissful bhakti experienced at different cakras are named in various ways. Historically these blissful forms of devotion were experienced by the devotees of Krsna in the land of Vraja (in present day Uttar Pradesh state). This is why it is said,\n\n\u003e When the ku켻d패alinii reaches the navel cakra, or ma켻ipura cakra, that is called vraja bh치va in Vae콑켻ava Tantra.\n\u003e \n\u003e -Kr콑켻a Unparalleled, Discourses on Kr콑켻a and the Giita\n\n#### Bh치va Sam치dhi\n\nThis involves once again the transcendence of another fetter of the Creative Principle (Shakti). As Shrii Sarkar states,\n\n\u003e Then when the aspirant crosses the cordon of the mutative principle, that stage is known as bh치va sam치dhi. At that stage the aspirant feels that he is with his Cosmic Goal. There is no Universe. At that stage, he ignores the entitative existence of the Universe. But he feels that he is with his Lord. He enjoys divine bliss, but it becomes very difficult for him to express, that is, he cannot express it.렢n\u003e \n\u003e You Should Do Accordingly, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 12\n\nThe power of this state is explained as follows:\n\n\u003e When the s치dhaka feels the existence of the divine world around him, as also the source from which the divine existence comes, the state of bliss the s치dhaka experiences at the time of s치dhan치 is bh치va during bh치va, the s치dhaka feels proximity to God, feels great bliss and falls down.\n\u003e \n\u003e -Dasha, Bh치va and Mah치bh치va, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 33\n\n#### S치miipya Devotional Sam치dhi\n\nThe second form of R치g치nuga Bhakti is a blissful trance known as S치miipya Sam치dhi. Briefly, Shrii Sarkar explains its essence saying,\n\n\u003e Then when this coiled serpentine, sleeping divinity, crosses the ma켻ipura cakra, just near the hub, the controlling point, of the pancreas, the person enjoys another sort of pleasure, and that pleasure is called s치miipya sam치dhi. S치miipya is a Sanskrit word. It means 랋roximity. That is, the s치dhaka feels his or her proximity to the Supreme Father.  \n\u003e In the first stage, the s치dhaka felt that the Supreme Father was there in the same status. He is not in the sky, he is everywhere, He is with you. If you are here and He is in the sky, then you are alone here, and He is also alone there. No, no, no, no. In the first phase the feeling was that Where I am, He is also with me. And in the second phase, I have come very close, very near, that Supreme Father; I am in close proximity to the Supreme Progenitor. By dint of my s치dhan치, the gap between my Father and myself is being bridged. It is the second phase, known as s치miipya. S치miipya means 딿roximity.\n\u003e \n\u003e -Stages of Samadhi, Discourses on Tantra 1\n\n#### NeoHumanism\n\nNow the reader may wonder, what is the point of these rare mystical states  how will they benefit society? In reality these spiritual states, these states of bhakti enable one to become a true universalist. For one cannot become a universalist unless one transcends the weaknesses and self-centredness of ou minds. This universal love for all being based on bhakti that serves to protect bhakti in society from narrow, violent sentiments is known as NeoHumanism. The first stage of NeoHumanism associated with the pashu is described below.\n\n\u003e Human existence is not merely physical, psychic or spiritual; it comprises all three. In this case, what should be the proper approach? The first step is spiritual cult [yoga]. What is it? The entire Cosmological order includes the quinquelemental material world, which is controlled by the Macropsychic Entity. Again, behind this Macropsychic Entity is a Macro-Spirit.  \n\u003e In fact, this universe of ours is a Macropsychic conation (a thought of the Cosmic Mind), so in no case can human beings deny this physical world. One will have to deeply analyse all the inconsistencies of this physical world, and this process of analysis will be conducted by the micropsychic existence (individual mind).  \n\u003e There are many people with tremendous mental potentiality, but they do not have a clear line of thought. Thus they think incorrectly, and the outcome of their defective thought is defective action. Those people are not properly guided on how to move in the mental world; they are not being properly guided unto the path of the Macropsychic Entity.  \n\u003e When someone commits a wrong, we have a tendency to condemn him or her at every step. We should realize that such a person suffers from a sort of micropsychic ailment, and to cure such an ailment we will have to introduce him or her to Neohumanistic philosophy. We have not done so, and that was our crime  \n\u003e What is spiritual cult? It is physico-psycho-spiritual cult. This physico-psycho-spiritual process will show you how to remove the defects of the psychic world and also the external world, and enable you to move towards the spiritual world without any delay. This movement towards the spiritual goal will also help you to establish yourself in the psychic and physical worlds, so you will be able to render greater service to the people. This is what I call 랍piritual cult. Progress in this spiritual cult starts with the elevation of protoplasmic cells, and finally ends in the attainment of the Supreme Goal. This physico-psycho-spiritual cult will help the physical world and the psyches of the psychic world directly and indirectly, and also the spiritual world, directly.렢n\u003e \n\u003e -Neohumanism Is the Ultimate Shelter, The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism\n\n#### PROUT\n\nUpon the solid foundation of NeoHumanism alone can PROUT blossom. Now what is PROUT? What are the PROUT activities of the pashu? Let us briefly explore this.\n\nFirstly one must study the sutras and the books on PROUT. This includes not just academic study but the practical research of how to apply them locally to solve the current and future problems. To gain an in-depth understanding however one needs to meditate on these principles. The realizations about these principles that one experiences via spiritual practice are the true Ideas and it is the assimilation and dissemination of these experiences in one뗩 mind and in the society that is the real Ideology.\n\nIn PROUT, everything is given in a nutshell or in encapsulated form. The reasons being firstly, that capitalists should not be able to manipulate the PROUT movement into a utopian dream. Secondly, so that PROUT can evolve in kaleidoscopic ways as per local socio-cultural ecoregions. The idea of a socio-cultural ecoregion is termed by Shrii Sarkar as a Sam치ja. Shrii Sarkar defines this saying,_Sam치nam ejati iti sam치jah_[Society is the collective movement of a group of individuals who have made a unanimous decision to move together towards a common goal]. Shrii Sarkar explains this saying,\n\n\u003e That is, society is the collective movement of a group of individuals who have made a unanimous decision to move towards a common goal. If human beings move closely together in all aspects of life, except for those few aspects which are very personal, the better it will be for the welfare of society.렢n\u003e \n\u003e -Cooperatives, Proutist Economics\n\nIn reality, such a genuine society has not yet been seen in the last 15,000 years of human civilization. Instead inequality, discrimination and exploitation have festered like tumours in societies throughout human history. It is only rarely that genuine unity has blossomed in a group of people. Shrii Sarkar gives the example of a pilgrimage. Here a religious pilgrimage to a so-called holy place is not the idea. Rather Shrii Sarkar refers to the pilgrimage of devotees singing and dancing in divine bliss. This has been seen in the medieval Bhakti Movement in Indian history. This kind of pilgrimage is society in nuclear form.\n\n\u003e What is society like? It is like a group of people going on a pilgrimage. Try to imagine the scene! Suppose one of the pilgrims is struck down by cholera. Will the rest of them continue on their way, leaving the sick man behind? No, that would be inconceivable for them. Rather, they will break their journey for a day or two, and cure him of his disease. If he is still too weak to walk they will carry him on their shoulders. If some people run short of food, others share what they have with them. Together they share their possessions, and together they march ahead, singing in unison. In their eagerness to move ahead with others they forget their trifling differences which might have led to angry exchanges and court cases in their families, even down to three generations. It is because of the petitions of the complainant in a land dispute that some people go so far as to spend ten or twenty times more than the piece of land is worth. The essence of cooperation resulting from this collective movement aims at expanding a person뗩 mind by striking down the barriers of meanness. I repeat that a true society is like such a group of pilgrims who attain a deep psychic affinity while travelling together which helps them solve all the problems in their individual and social lives  \n\u003e If going ahead in mutual adjustment only out of narrow self interest or momentary self-seeking is called society, then in such a society, no provision can be made for the disabled, the diseased or the helpless, because in most cases nobody can benefit from them in any way. Hence it will not suffice to say that all people marching ahead is only a collective form of segregated psychic phenomena; for in that case there always remains the possibility of some people getting isolated from the collective. All human beings must attach themselves to others by the common bond of love, and march forward hand in hand, then only will I proclaim it a society.\n\u003e \n\u003e -The Spirit of Society, A Few Problems Solved Part 6\n\nThe question arises how does one define such a cultural region? PROUT mandates the following criteria:\n\n1.  Same economic problems\n2.  Uniform economic potentialities\n3.  Ethnic similarities\n4.  Sentimental legacy of the people\n5.  Similar geographical features.\n\nThe foundation of the samaja movement is economic revolution to establish economic democracy. In capitalism, socialism and communism, the power to control the national and regional economies lies in the hands of a few people  be they state-capitalist bureaucrats or corrupt corporations. The end result is that we have firstly unscientific economic planning because the elites are far away from the regions they exploit and hence cannot fully utilise their economic potentialities without destroying the environment.\n\nSecondly we find rampant economic exploitation of the local people. This is because the people are unable to control their own economic destiny. They are simply slaves in the hands of economic dictators. This is why economic freedom is the freedom struggle of the 21st Century. PROUT demands that every community have basic freedom to control the utilization of its natural resources (both in the form of extraction and industries) and for all members of the community to be provided the basic amenties such as food, medical care, housing, clothing and education as well as a fair share of any excess production or wealth.\n\nSo the PROUTists have to study the economic potentialities and biodiversity (variety of plant and animal species) of their area. Then they have to work with villages (panchayats) to help them plan their economic destiny. Finally representatives of villages will be aided in planning the economic development of their block (sub-district). They will then try to materialize these plans through the creation of network of local cooperatives.\n\nHowever the movement for economic liberation is just a small part of PROUT. Hand in hand, there is the social movement of NeoHumanism which seeks to liberate one뗩 region from narrow sentiments. These include geographic sentiments (national, provincial, etc.) social sentiments (race, caste, religion, etc.) and pseudo-humanism (species-ism; false feeling of being superior and having right to exploit and destroy plants and animals.\n\nNow the reader may ask, is not Samaja a geo-sentiment. The answer is no. Samaja is a love for a region based on universal love for the Divinity within all beings and all places. Geo-sentiments need to be transformed into samaja sentiment. Shrii Sarkar explains this process saying,\n\n\u003e Any narrow 딸sm may be transformed into universalism and accepted by all only when all physical barriers, psychic hindrances and spiritual impediments have been removed from the periphery of that 딸sm.\n\u003e \n\u003e -Religious Dogma, Prout in a Nutshell Volume 4 Part 16\n\nThe most crucial aspect of samaja is cultural. Firstly every culture of every language needs to be developed spiritually. During the time of Lord Shiva this happened through the mass spread of Tantra meditation from the Himalayas to South India and to the Alps and southern China. Lord Shiva뗩 disciples spread it even further into such remote regions as Siberia and Mokheshvara (later known as Mokka and then Makka or Mecca). Today we need such a yoga revolution in every culture, using for example local gods to refer to various cakras and making meditation, devotional songs and kiirtana (singing the Lord뗩 Name) a part of various popular festivals.\n\nThe second form of spiritual revolution in every culture is seen in the Bhakti and Sufi movements of India, Greater Iran, Turkey and Albania. However there must be no tolerance of the dogmas, superstitions, discrimination and intolerance of various religious scriptures and priests. The Bhakti movement in nearly every Indian language transformed these languages into classical languages drenched in the ethos of divine love. The same thing happened in the Persian and Sindhi languages due to the Sufi movement.\n\nSecondly we need a renaissance of new literature, new drama, new music, new dance, new fine arts in each language of one뗩 region. This includes not just the main language but also adivasi or indigenous languages.\n\nIn order to develop the culture we need an Education Revolution. Vast numbers of people remain illiteratre or barely literate without having even graduated high school. This is due to deliberate neglect by governments, exploitation which seeks to keep people uneducated and due to victimisation of people of certain social groups based on race, caste or religion. However, the problems do not end there. In areas with a large percentage of education we find higher rates of suicide and often greater immorality, exploitation and corruption. This is because of the failure of both Western materialistic education and dogmatic religious education.\n\nIn light of this, PROUT seeks to liberate the educational sector from both governmental propaganda and control of corrupt corporations. Education should be conducted by autonomous bodies at the local and regional levels. Furthermore education must teach children to be revolutionaries. They need to understand the glories and tragedies of the history of their samajas. They need to understand the various forms of exploitation they and their communities face. And they above need spiritual inspiration to persevere in morality despite all obstacles and persection. It is this perseverance that develops moral courage to fight against all odds.\n\nNow the heart of such educational movements is a linguistic revolution. Shrii Sarkar wrote extensively developing the philology of the Bengali language. He revised and reformulated the grammar and revealed the dialects, sub-dialects and blended dialects (of Bengali with neighbouring languages) of the language. He added new letters, new meanings of words, revealed the spiritual roots (acoustic roots) of language in relation to biopsychology among so many other service to Bengali. In addition, the languages of Bihar repressed by Hindi imperialism such as Angika and Bhojpure, he developed the basic grammar where there was none before and started newspapers in these languages. He admonished all disciples that it was the duty of people from developed languages and cultures to develop the vocabulary, script and textbooks of all the repressed, undeveloped languages of the world. In particular the dialects of poor communities and the languages of tribes are to be developed.\n\nFinally there if the political revolution of samaja movements. Politics refers to primarily the administration at various levels of the region  how well the laws are enforced, how well are persecuted segments of society protected, how well establish are the rights of local people to be free from the threat of corporate landgrabbing  this is the practical element of politics. This is the heart of PROUT along with economic democracy. As Shrii Sarkar says,\n\n\u003e The duty of Renaissance Universal (movement) is to make intellectual appeals, and the work of the Proutists is to see whether law and order is strictly enforced or not. If it is not enforced strictly or if it goes against the principles of Yama and Niyama, enforcement is to be done by creating pressure of circumstances.\n\u003e \n\u003e _Discourses on PROUT, Prout in a Nutshell Volume 1 Part 5_\n\nThis involves rousing the people to fight for their rights in the form of participatory budgeting so that the local government acts to fulfil the needs of the local people and their collective economic plans. Shrii Sarkar explains that this political revolution has two stages:\n\n\u003e To make people conscious of their rights in every sphere of life  social, economic, psychic and spiritual  is called [ji攷치na vist치ra (true expansion of one뗩 knowledge); and to (fight so they can) exercise these rights fully is called viji攷치na s치dhan치 (the true spiritual practice of wisdom and enlightenment).]\n\u003e \n\u003e -Social Justice, Human Society Part 1\n\nTo materialize economic plans requires the full cooperation of the local and regional government. When the legislators, police, administrators are under the control of outside capitalist exploiters then social pressure must be brought to bear to force them to serve the people they are sworn to protect.  \nAll of these 6 different dimensions of the samaja movements originate and culminate in spirituality. Why? It is because of the power of collective meditation to create social movements. As Shrii Sarkar states,\n\n\u003e The indomitable mental force aroused as a result of collective Iishvara Pra켻idh치na will help you solve any problem, great or small, on this earth.\n\u003e \n\u003e -Iishvara Pranidhana, A Guide to Human Conduct\n\nThe many dimensions of the internal and external revolutions described briefly thus far serve to transform pashus (animals) into viiras or heroes. One starts being a hero by attempting to live, talk and behave like one. As Shrii Sarkar explains,\n\n\u003e In collective life as well, when this stage comes, those who are well advanced, who understand better, who are more courageous, more firmly established in morality, who are truly righteous, they have to take the lead, to assume the mantle of leadership. In such times those who worry about what others will say or think, or worry about being criticized, and due to this fear hide behind closed doors thinking that if they take action their good name will be tarnished. Such people are not true human beings. They are beggars, begging for reputation. They have no manliness; they have lost the courage to move ahead. At that time those who come forward and say  Let뗩 go. I뗤 with you. If trouble comes, let it come. I뗣l take it on my shoulders  such people I have given the name sadvipra.\n\u003e \n\u003e _The Significance of the Word Yuga, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 9_","lastmodified":"2023-05-22T03:06:06.345499322Z","tags":["sadvipra"]},"/notes/THE-FORGING-OF-THE-SADVIPRA-2-VIIRA":{"title":"The Forging Of The Sadvipra 2","content":"[[sadvipra]]\nWith the attainment of the status of a viira, Tantra begins to blossom in one뗩 life. To become a hero means to become a leader through dedication, sincerity, ideological zeal, fighting spirit and all-round capacity. Such heroes are physically fit, mentally developed and spiritually elevated. People will recognize such proto-Sadvipras by their exemplary conduct, selfless service, dutifulness and moral integrity. Such heroes are not simply motivated by external pressure orchestrated by the Sadguru, rather they now acquire and internal urge for expansion and for heroic deeds. They feel that the source of psychic inspiration is that Supreme Controller. And they are to fight against all depraving, all degenerating, forces with the help of that Supreme Entity. Struggle in the mental sphere is harder and more complicated than in the material sphere. As such, more mental power, more powerful nerve fibres and nerve cells are required. Shrii Sarkar explains the evolution of such heroes as follows:\n\n\u003e With continued spiritual practice according to the dictates of the Master, the aspirant comes to [human status], or viirabh치va. Animals need external pressure: in pashv치c치ra s치dhan치; one controls oneself to attain elevation to viirabh치va. Those beyond the animal stage cannot get elevation through external control only. They need external pressure and internal urge. With the rise of a spiritual inspiration, the aspirant becomes a viira (noble) and when this viirabh치va is fully assimilated, the person becomes godlike.  \n\u003e This practical truth is the basis of the science of Tantra. There is no conflict between Tantra and natural sciences. According to their mental stages, human beings can be classified into animalistic, noble and godly. The master initiates the disciple according to the person뗩 mental and spiritual stage  \n\u003e In the viir치c치ra stage, spiritual aspirants attain greater mental and moral force. They gradually start thinking that they are no longer ordinary persons. They overcome all their inferiority or fear complexes. They attain mental stability, also. They are viira (noble), and their Lord is Viireshvara.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Pashv치c치ra, Viir치c치ra and Divy치c치ra, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 33\n\nShrii Sarkar explains the necessity of divine Grace to overcome the force of Cosmic Illusion saying,\n\n\u003e Now after this first phase is over, after the successful completion of the first struggle, the second one starts. This second struggle occurs both externally and internally, and for this the s치dhakas must be sufficiently bold. This boldness comes as a result of the first fight. In this second phase the spiritual aspirants struggle like heroes, and address their Lord as Viireshvara. So in this second phase of struggle, their Lord Sad치shiva becomes Viireshvara, the Lord of Heroes. Now the spiritual aspirants are no longer animals or pashus, they are heroes or viiras  \n\u003e In the second phase, too, there are mental obstacles, but they too can be overcome by the Grace of the Lord. For He clearly says:  \n\u003e Daevii hye콑치 gu켻amayii mama M치y치 duratyay치;  \n\u003e M치meva ye prapadyante M치y치met치拷 taranti te. (Gita)  \n\u003e This M치y치, this depraving faculty, this avidy치 shakti, is my M치y치: she is under my control  Shakti s치 shivasya shaktih. So those spiritual aspirants who have surrendered at the altar of the Supreme need not be afraid of M치y치 because the Lord before whom they have surrendered controls that very M치y치. Daeviiye콑a gu켻amayii mama M치y치 duratyay치: This M치y치 of mine is insurmountable. But M치meva ye prapadyante  Those who have taken shelter in Me  M치y치met치拷 taranti te  랑ill easily surmount this M치y치. So spiritual aspirants need not be afraid of this M치y치: She can do nothing because the Lord is with them. In pashv치c치ra and viir치c치ra, they are helped by the Lord to fight against M치y치.\n\u003e \n\u003e  The Essence of Spiritual Progress\n\nThe moral character of such a hero is explained thus:\n\n\u003e Te콑치拷 ji攷치na prak치sh치ya viirabh치va prak치shitah  ㄹnd when they feel, when they realize, when they understand, what to do and what not to do, what are the dos of life and what are the don뗪s of life, then they become bold. Why bold? They are to fight against all sorts of adversities, all sorts of troubles, all sorts of inimical attitudes. So they are certainly heroes; and a hero in Sanskrit is called a viira. So at that stage of humanity when this viirabh치va develops, when a person becomes ready to fight against all opposite forces, he is a viira. In Tantra this is called viirabh치va, and for him, the Supreme Entity is Viireshvara. The man becomes viira, and his Lord becomes Viireshvara  no longer Pashupati, but Viireshvara. One of the names of Parama Puru콑a is Viireshvara.  \n\u003e When the person is fully established in viirabh치va  that is, he is never to be frightened, never to be defeated, never to accept any defeat (you girls should remember that here 랃e means 랍he also)  then he is established in viirabhava. And that bh치va is called divyabh치va. And that man is no longer known as viira. He is a deva, or devat치  \n\u003e Now, I have said that a person has three types of expression: One expression is thinking, the thinking faculty, and the second one is speaking In the first the function is within the nerve cells, and in the second, the function is  where? With the lips. And the third action is action with the physical body, corporal action  \n\u003e And in the second phase, that is, in the viira stage, the thought-waves move like that but the words and the actions are one. That is, there are some differences between thoughts on the one hand, and words and actions on the other hand, but the words and the actions are the same. What these people say, they do. In society, these people, these people of viirabh치va, are respected as great men, as Mah치puru콑as, as leaders of society, as leaders of the country. But there is a defect in them also, because their thoughts and their actions are not the same. Their actions and words are the same, but their thoughts are not the same. Do you follow? They are [in] viirabh치va, they are viira; their Lord is Viireshvara.\n\u003e \n\u003e  From Animality to Divinity\n\nIn fact Shrii Sarkar defines the very nature of meditation as being the fight against the crude forces dominating our minds and our communities and our Cosmos.\n\n\u003e After starting S치dhan치, one starts psychic fighting against the crude force, the crude force functioning within the mind, the crude force functioning within the society, the crude force functioning within the family and the crude force functioning within the country. One starts fighting, so one becomes 랐iira. This 랐iirata in fighting is actual S치dhana. This is life. Life is the constant fight against belligerent forces. Life is fight. When one starts to fight one becomes a human in human structure  \n\u003e This fight against the centrifugal force, functioning in the world, is actually the S치dhan치. You know, in each and every structure there are two forces, centripetal and centrifugal forces. In the case of cosmological order, in the case of Brahma Cakra [the Cosmic Cycle of evolution and involution], the Centripetal force, is called Vidy치 and the Centrifugal force is called Avidy치. So spiritual practice or the intuitional practice is the fight between Vidy치 and Avidy치. S치dhan치 is to strengthen vidy치, the centripetal force, in one뗩 movement towards the nave of the cosmological order.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Triangle of Forces and the Supreme Entity\n\nShrii Sarkar explains how this endless fight in endless dimensions of our lives is part of the Macrocosmic dynamics saying,\n\n\u003e Life is to fight. Now when one starts fight, then he becomes a man in human structure. He is no longer a brute in human structure, he is a man in human structure. And in that phase he says: O Lord, by Your mercy, by Your grace, I have become a hero, I have started fighting against debasing forces functioning within my mind, functioning within my family, functioning within the society. So by Your grace I have become a hero. I am a hero, I am a viira, thou art Viireshvara [Lord of Heroes].  \n\u003e So in the second phase of s치dhan치, Pashupati becomes Viireshvara. It is another name of Lord Shiva. Pashupati becomes Viireshvara. And as a result of further fight, when this fighting tendency, this belligerent tendency, becomes his wont, in that case He becomes a deva, he is called a deva  \n\u003e Now, this fight, this fight against the eccentric force fighting, eccentric force functioning, in the world, is actually the s치dhan치. You know, in each and every structure, there are two forces, the centripetal force and the centrifugal force. In the case of this Cosmological world, in the case of this Cosmological system, in the case of this Brahma Cakra, the centripetal force, the centre-seeking force, is called vidy치, and the centrifugal force is called avidy치. So this spiritual practice, or intuitional practice, is a fight between vidy치 and avidy치. A s치dhaka is to strengthen his vidy치, his centripetal force, in his movement towards the nave of this Cosmological order, towards the nucleus of this Cosmological order  because of the fact that this Cosmological nucleus is the nucleus of all other nuclei of the universe. It is the abode of supreme beatitude. All other nuclei of the universe are sheltered in Him. (That뗩 why he is called N치r치ya켻a. Ayana means 랍helter. And N치ra means Operative Principle.) There is no other way. If one wants peace of permanent nature, if one has developed the longing for supreme beatitude, one has no alternative but to move towards this Supreme Nucleus; and this movement is s치dhan치. And while moving towards this Supreme Nucleus, one will have to fight against the centrifugal force, the avidy치 shakti.  \n\u003e In this fight against avidy치 shakti one must have sufficient weapons. You know, a soldier requires weapons, and s치dhan치 is a fight. In your internal sphere, that is, in your mind, you should have ten weapons. Those ten weapons are five Yama and five Niyama [moral principles]. And similarly, while fighting against evil forces in this crude physicality, you should have ultra-modern physical weapons also. Those who want disarmament and those who want to ban the atom bomb are not friends of human society. They do not want to accelerate the speed of human society. Rather they want to retard its progress. Weapons you must have, but you should have control over your body and mind. There must not be any abuse or misuse of your weapons.  \n\u003e Now, in this progress, that is, in the realm of intuitionalism, you should have ten internal weapons  Yama and Niyama  and your progress in s치dhan치 depends on ji攷치na [wisdom], karma [service work] and bhakti [devotion]. Your progress is effected by ji攷치na and karma.\n\u003e \n\u003e  I Have Become a Hero\n\nFinally, we see how this heroism can rescue humanity.\n\n\u003e Those who can dedicate their all to the thought of the Great and the inspiration of the Supreme are verily the most heroic. Indeed, they are the virtuous, and they alone are capable of taking human history from darkness to light.\n\u003e \n\u003e  1 January 1965, 츼nanda V치켻ii Sa拷쯚raha\n\n#### Vyatireka\n\nAs we have seen the different stages of the forging of the Sadvipra are associated with different levels of pratyah치ra or yogic withdrawal and merger with the innermost Consciousness. Thus,\n\n\u003e The second phase is called vyatireka. The aspirant establishes his control [over] a particular internal or external enemy but [is] still defeated by certain desires. Suppose there is a man who never takes bribes. He has established his control over the propensity of lobha [greed]. But he may be addicted to drink, so there he is defeated. Or that man may be a miserly fellow. Again he is defeated. Or that man may have some special attraction to some house, land or other property. In this phase, one has established oneself [over] certain propensities or [over] certain degrading elements or enemies, but is defeated by some other elements or enemies. This second phase of human approach is called vyatireka. Here also one cannot move a step forward without the grace of the Supreme, because one뗩 fighting stamina gets inspiration from the Supreme.\n\u003e \n\u003e  The Phases of Human Approach, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 30\n\nIt is not simply that we may be dominated by one propensity. Instead we can be dominated by a propensity only when it comes to certain objects. For example,\n\n\u003e In one matter we have no greed, but in another we have tremendous greed. These all belong to the category of vyatireka. It is called vyatireka because when kal치 [mental curvatures] is getting transformed into k치콑t패h치 (it is not always the case that kal치 shall be transformed into k치콑t패h치), sometimes k치콑t패h치 [linear flow of the mind] becomes smaller than the kal치, while at other times, under the pressure of k치콑t패h치, the subsequent kal치 becomes larger than its normal state.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Vyatireka  the Stage of Control, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 10\n\nThe psychological basis of this state is explained as follows:\n\n\u003e In the second stage, vyatireka, the propensities are directed from the citta to the aha拷쯦attva [doer I렣. This stage is less trying than yatam치na. In fact, occasionally it is slightly pleasing. The kicking wild horses have been broken to some extent, and for brief intervals these partially-tamed mental propensities do follow the direction from the citta to the aha拷쯦attva. During these intervals the s치dhaka enjoys bits, shreds, and glimpses of bliss. Tears of such bliss may roll down his cheeks. In this period the external pressures are also lessened, because friends and relatives have become somewhat reconciled to the other-worldly pursuits of the s치dhaka.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Yatam치na, Vyatireka, Ekendriya and Vashiik치ra, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 33\n\n#### Ekendriya\n\nNow the viira or heroic personality is also associated with the third stage of pratyah치ra. This is the state in which all vrttis are absorbed in one sentiment. Ekendriya means gaining full control over a particular psychic propensity. Once con trolled, it will never return, will never cause further degeneration. Full control over a certain psychic vrtti is known as ekendriya. What will be the result, for example, if a person gains full control over the vak indriya, the organ of speech? Whatever he or she will say will come true. This is called vak siddhi. This is part of the Tantric process of mental expansion.  \nHowever, the lack of a divine goal can lead to disaster. One may attain a trance of absorption and some occult powers by meditation on sensory-motor organs, on the 5 rudimental factors of matter (solid, liquid, luminous, aerial and ethereal) on the sensory inferences (smell, taste, form, touch, sound) but we cannot attain liberation from material consciousness and liberation from or mental propensities. Instead we gradually or rapidly become corrupted. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely. This is not simply a political truism but a spiritual one as well.\n\n\u003e In the ekendriya stage, which is the third stage in praty치h치ra one expands one뗩 ectoplasmic sphere just like a cloud filling the sky  whenever the cloud passes over an object it brings it within its sphere of influence. But this is not so in the case of Parama Puru콑a. Whenever His mental sphere increases, numerous entities emerge within His mind, remain in a state of flow for some time and subsequently dissolved back into Him. The microcosms which are created, maintained and dissolved within the Cosmic Mind are qualitatively almost the same manner as Parama Puru콑a, but of course they differ quantitatively. The Cosmic Mind is extremely vast; the unit mind is tiny. The unit mind only expands in the ectoplasmic sphere, like the cloud filling the sky, and in the process of expansion brings other unit minds within its sphere of control. When it expands tremendously it can also assert some influence on the Cosmic Mind  \n\u003e Suppose a person is trying to expand the mind, not to attain Parama Puru콑a, but a crude goal such as name, fame or wealth. In that process the science is the same but the actual path is different. One who follows this path becomes mentally degenerated. This state is called Prakrtiliina avasth치 in scripture. For such people become as crude as matter. A person whose mind is engrossed in money becomes money itself. Yes, a conscious human being gets converted into crude money. Human beings are aware that they are human, but a rupee doesn뗪 know it뗩 a rupee. There are other categories like this such as yak콑a [obsessed with wealth], gandharv치 [with music and the arts], kinnara [with beauty], vidy치dhara [with knowledge], [prakrtiliina 늞bsessed with material objects or idol worshippers or those dominated by revulsion/rejection of the world] vidhehaliina [obsessed with worldly problems or those who worship the Void or Nothingness] and siddha [those who feel superior to others due to their spiritual attainments or those who are attached to occult powers] which have been categorized according to the degree of ectoplasmic crudity or subtlety. You are the master of your ectoplasm  you can expand it across the vast sky, or you can confine it to the horizon of a solitary cloud. It depends on your will.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Ekendriya  1, Ananda Marga Philosophy in a Nutshell Part 6\n\nShrii Sarkar explains how this level is connected with worldly and spiritual love as follows:\n\n\u003e What is the actual import of ekendriya? At first the mind is drawn towards the entity in a particular way  it flows unhindered across the boundary of liking and enters the sphere of love. At that time the mind neither has the desire nor the scope for any distraction whatsoever. All it wants is to flow towards the object it loves. If it encounters a second entity on the way it will ignore it, so strong is its one pointed pursuit for its object of love.  \n\u003e Uc치t패an man n치 m치ne b치ra켻,  \n\u003e Shudhu t치ri p치ne chut패e y치y.  \n\u003e [The mind is extremely impatient  it listens to no one,  \n\u003e But rushes towards its object of love.]  \n\u003e So the mind moves towards that Supreme One. You may know some people whose minds always run after money. You might have asked them to sit down for a while and have a chat, and been surprised by their excusing themselves, saying they were so busy and had to rush off to the stock exchange. If their pursuit of money is hampered in any way, if it eludes their grasp, if they are totally severed from it, their minds will lose their base and they will die.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Ekendriya  3, Ananda Marga Philosophy in a Nutshell Part 6\n\nHow then does this movement towards the Supreme take place? It is via focused concentration with every fibre of one뗩 being.\n\n\u003e To bring about the greatest fulfilment of life, s치dhakas will have to reach the pinnacle of the state of ekendriya. That is, instead of directing their mind-stuff towards crude objects, they must channelize their minds towards the Macrocosm, and embrace the Macrocosm fully as their goal.  \n\u003e Pra켻avo dhanuh sharohy치tm치 Brahma tallak콑yamucyate  \n\u003e Apramattena vedhavya拷 sharattanmayo bhavet.  \n\u003e ㄹ s치dhaka who utilizes his spiritual practice as the bow his self as the arrow, and Parama Puru콑a as the target and then tries to pierce the target with undivided attention, attains the Supreme Goal.  \n\u003e S치dhakas who accept this sloka as the supreme and final guidance and move accordingly along the path of ekendriya s치dhan치 are capable of devoting the mind to the highest stage of spiritual realization. Their lives become so meaningful. It is not enough to only ideate on Brahma [Supreme Consciousness], one must also practice ekendriya s치dhan치. Here ekendriya means that all the expressions of the sensory and motor nerves and all the energy and subtle power of the organs should be focused on one point. The consolidated power of the nerves, indriyas, and mind stuff should be directed towards the supreme goal. This unidirectional movement towards the goal is the stage of ekendriya. In this stage the s치dhaka does not attach any importance to any particular indriya, idea or thought, but attaches paramount importance to the supreme goal. Such a s치dhaka ultimately arises above both vidy치 and avidy치 Tantra.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Ekendriya  8, Ananda Marga Philosophy in a Nutshell Part 6\n\nIn this stage the spiritual aspirant craves for direct contact with the Beloved Master thus:\n\n\u003e Oh Parama Puru콑a please appear suddenly in the dark corners of my mind. Let me see you with my mental eyes. This type of 땁eeing with one뗩 mental eyes is called ekendriya. The eyes are as indriya. Similarly, the r콑i prays, Oh Lord, come still closer to me so that I can serve you. Here the devotee wants to attain the Lord through the indriya of touch. Or the r콑i may pray, Oh Lord, play your sweet flute so I can hear your divine tune and be absorbed in you, forgetting myself. Please come to me in the form of a blissful melody. This is an attempt to attain Him through a different indriya  the auditory organ. So these are examples of the initial attempts to come into the closest proximity of Parama Puru콑a. This is not the first but the third stage of sadhana.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Ekendriya -4, Ananda Marga Philosophy in a Nutshell Part 6\n\nThe ensuing spiritual experiences are,\n\n\u003e Then comes ekendriya, which is the third stage of progress in s치dhan치. This is the stage when one has control over a particular mental propensity, and that control is more lasting. Due to constant repetition, the mantra is sounding in one뗩 ear. While sitting in meditation, a s치dhaka can see his or her I콑t패a moving around him or her, and the fragrance of sandalwood or rose comes from the body of the I콑t패a. Sometimes one gets it and sometimes one does not get it.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Bio-Psycho-Spiritual System of Kiirtana, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 30\n\nThe psychological transformation of this practice and the dangers of the resultant occult powers is explained as follows:\n\n\u003e In the third stage, ekendriya, the upward direction is followed from the aha拷쯦attva to the mahattattva. As the very name ekendriya implies, the s치dhaka gains control over some single propensity or organ, which brings to him a corresponding occult power.  \n\u003e Occult power (called vibh칰ti or aeshvarya in Sanskrit) is the supernatural power gained from the practice of the psychic mystic cult. The eight vibh칰tis are a켻im치, laghim치, mahim치, pr치pti, iishitva, vashitva, pr치k치mya, and antary치mitva. This stage marks a great step forward. However, this is a dangerous stage also. The danger comes more from inside than from outside. The s치dhaka may get intoxicated with the feeling of the occult power and be tempted to abuse it. Moreover, there is the external threat that somebody may provoke him into such abuse. Any misuse of these powers causes a setback or even a downfall in the spiritual journey. Abuse of power is bad in any sphere. Even in the temporal sphere misuse of power leads to downfall. Power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely  unless there is the strength to control the power.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Yatam치na, Vyatireka, Ekendriya and Vashiik치ra, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 33\n\nThe service dimension of this state is explained beautifully as follows:\n\n\u003e In the third stage of s치dhan치 s치dhakas accepts the cognitive faculty as their goal. They wish to advance along the spiritual path while simultaneously serving the subtler expressions of Parama Puru콑a. This is the true Dharma of human beings. The sad치vrata (mass feeding) which you organize comes within the scope of this practice. While performing s치dhan치 in this stage the human mind attains a greater proximity to Parama Puru콑a and sees the entire universe as a divine expression of Parama Puru콑a. Through this realization one enjoys pure unblemished bliss. When people served good food during sadavrata smile happily you feel inner joy.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Vashiik치ra  2, Ananda Marga Philosophy in a Nutshell Part 6\n\nShrii Sarkar has said that PROUT will established in the hearts of the common people through such service programmes.\n\n#### Bhaeravii Shakti\n\nAs we have seen the various shaktis emerge in different stages of the Cosmic Cycle. The stage of the viira is concerned with Bhaeravii Shakti. This Shakti evolves thus,\n\n\u003e Prakrti is active from k치mabiija [Shambhuliunga; primordial source of creation] to the kal치 [curvature, Cosmic Ahamkara] and is called Bhaeravii in the n치da stage, and Puru콑a is termed Bhaerava.\n\u003e \n\u003e  The Creation of the Universe, Idea and Ideology\n\nSo the next phase in the spiritual process of becoming a Sadvipra is as follows:\n\n\u003e And then the mutative principle has to be withdrawn from K치lik치 [Bhav치nii] shakti and merged in Bhaeravii shakti (the acoustic root of Bhaeravii shakti is sha拷). Bhaeravii shakti means energy in action.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Discourse 8, Namah Shiv치ya Sh치nt치ya\n\nShrii Sarkar explains who the struggle to elevate and control Bhaeravii Shakti is the only way one can triumph over the social forces as follows:\n\n\u003e Devotees elevate themselves from Bhav치nii Shakti to Bhaeravii Shakti, from Bhaeravii Shakti to Kao콑ikii Shakti [energy of the Cosmic Nucleus], and finally attain oneness with the Supreme Entity. Those who pursue this path of divine adoration are called devotees. Whom do devotees ideate on? Certainly on Puru콑ottama [Cosmic Nucleus]. Those who accept matter as their object of ideation can never attain Puru콑ottama, but will invariably degenerate towards the staticity of Bhav치nii Shakti. Their entire being will ultimately be converted into inert matter. To ideate on Puru콑ottama means to transform Bhav치nii into Bhaeravii and Bhaeravii into Kao콑ikii, thereby establishing oneness between the devotee and the Lord. In the process of transforming crude waves into subtle waves, devotees become one with their final goal. If one뗩 movement is towards the crude, one뗩 psycho-physical waves will become cruder and cruder. But if one뗩 movement is towards the Supreme, if Bhav치nii Shakti is transformed into Bhaeravii Shakti, then one뗩 waves will gradually straighten. The subtle waves of effulgence will also become straight. Thus a devotee뗩 movement towards the Supreme One is an endeavour to transform crude energy into subtle energy. To transform Bhav치nii Shakti into Bhaeravii Shakti both shraddh치 [implicit veneration for one뗩 goal] and viirya [stamina] are important. Without regular spiritual practice this transformation is impossible  \n\u003e Those people whose actions are indistinguishable from devotion are true devotees. Thus in the process of conversion of Bhav치nii Shakti into Bhaeravii Shakti, devotion plays a greater role than so-called action.  \n\u003e What is the source of inspiration of the individual뗩 efforts to convert crude energy into subtle energy? In this case the Cognitive Faculty is the source of inspiration. Bhaeravii Shakti is prevented from being converted into Bhav치nii Shakti with the help of the Cognitive Faculty, and with the help of the Cognitive Faculty Bhaeravii Shakti is merged in the cognitive flow.  \n\u003e In the struggle to transform Bhaeravii Shakti into Kao콑ikii Shakti, Citishakti [Cognitive Force] plays a dominant role, because Bhaeravii Shakti is the second stage of Citishakti in the flow of creation. The Cognitive Force manifests itself as Bhaeravii Shakti to expedite the evolution of mind. The will to evolve is primarily dependent on the active role of Bhaeravii Shakti. In fact Bhaeravii Shakti is one뗩 real I. It is with Her help that one must carry on one뗩 s치dhan치 to attain Citishakti  \n\u003e But if one뗩 movement is towards the Supreme, if Bhav치nii Shakti is transformed into Bhaeravii Shakti, then one뗩 waves will gradually straighten. The subtle waves of effulgence will also become straight. Thus a devotee뗩 movement towards the Supreme One is an endeavour to transform crude energy into subtle energy. To transform Bhav치nii Shakti into Bhaeravii Shakti both shraddh치 [implicit veneration for one뗩 goal] and viirya [heroic stamina] are important. Without regular spiritual practice this transformation is impossible뵬n the case of materialists who are puffed up with vanity: their Bhaeravii Shakti is gradually converted into Bhav치nii Shakti. Only devotees can expand Bhaeravii Shakti because only they cherish the desire for supreme union with the Cognitive Faculty. They do not ask the Supreme Being for wealth, opulence, fame or children, but pray, O Lord, please manifest Yourself fully in me. Make me Yours, O Lord. They continue to pray like this until they merge in the Supreme.  \n\u003e They continue their efforts to attain the Supreme with the physical and psychic strength already bestowed upon them by the Supreme Entity. To ask for extra power without first utilizing the power already given them would be to show disrespect to Parama Puru콑a. Only after all their power has been totally exhausted may they ask Parama Puru콑a for anything. If He so desires, Parama Puru콑a may grant that request through some third entity. While utilizing one뗩 energy one should pray to Parama Puru콑a, O Lord, I am working with the strength given by You. Let me not make the mistake of taking it to be my own power. Let me not forget You, O Lord.  \n\u003e As long as s치dhakas remain within the scope of Bhav치nii Shakti they observe that all finite entities of the universe are separate from one another. But when they enter the bounds of Bhaeravii Shakti after straightening the waves of Bhav치nii Shakti, they discover that all those previous differentiations have vanished into nothingness. The more the influence of Bhav치nii Shakti, the greater the feeling of differentiation; and the more the influence of Bhaeravii Shakti, the greater the feeling of unity  \n\u003e The Cosmic force that is active in the psychic sphere of microcosms is Bhaeravii Shakti. As Bhaeravii is the force which starts moving from a vertex of the unbalanced supreme triangle, one will have to concentrate one뗩 mind on a particular point in the process of s치dhan치  \n\u003e One who ideates on the Supreme Entity while engaged in individual and collective s치dhan치 establishes a happy correlation between Bhaeravii Shakti and one뗩 cognitive faculty. Such a person will never degenerate, even though his or her cherished supreme goal may not be fully realized  \n\u003e One who does not practise any active s치dhan치 to control these three shaktis and expand one뗩 cognitive faculty cannot fight against antisocial forces. This process of bringing these three shaktis within one뗩 control is called s치dhan치samara [the battle of intuitional practice]. This battle should end in one of two ways: in victory or in death. One should never undergo the ignominy of defeat\n\u003e \n\u003e  The Devotee and the Lord, The Devotee and the Lord\n\n#### T치켻d패ava\n\nTandava is the dance introduced 7500 years ago by Lord Shiva the father of global human civilization. It is because of the amazement of people seeing Him lost in blissfully doing Tandava with closed eyes and also seeing Him doing Tandava with flaming red eyes at Aryan imperialism or any injustice, that Shiva is called Nat뗘r치ja: N치tanun치t뗜sham (The One whose very body is made out of N치da  the primordial sound of creation (Cosmic Mahat)  is the Lord of Dance.) In September of 1971, Lord Shrii Shrii Anandamurtiji revived this dance in its original form which was an epochal event in the history of humanity since the days of Lord Shiva since now it is combined withTandava comes from the word tandu which means to jump. Tandu + the suffix sna makes Tandava, the dance where jumping predominates. Tandava is the fundamental step, 랎he primordial pace, of all Oriental dances.\n\nIt symbolizes the cosmic cycle which as per Tantra has 5 components, Srs뗪뗠 or creation, Sthiti or preservation and support, Samahara  destruction or evolution to a new life-form or to merger with Supreme Consciousness, Tirobhava or illusion and degradation and Anurgraha or grace, emancipation and salvation. The dance unites the blissful peace of Shiva with His resplendent dynamism. This may seem paradoxical but as per B츼B츼, the meaning of Shanti (the Sanskrit word for peace) derives from the root Sham which mmeans to fight and defeat thte anti-social forces. So Shiva is the supreme incarnation of peace because He fought unwaveringly against exploitation and injustice.\n\nThe inner spirit of Tandava is I will face the fear of death, which surrounds me on all sides and overcome it with the power of the life force of my mind. No force wil deter me from the goal. No evil tendency, no enemy, no bondage can shake my determination to be victorious. As B츼B츼 says, the mission of Tandava is, Destruction is inevitable, but I would continue to fight against destruction through struggle. So there is a skull in one hand and a dagger in the other. The skull represents destruction and the dagger represents fight. The underlying feeling is, I will not surrender to destruction or death. I will continue the struggle with this dagger.뙉렢n\nTandava dance in the fourth chapter of the N치t뗯a Shastra (ancient treatise on drama, dance and music) of Bharata Muni states that this Tandava dance has 108 k치ra켻as and 32 anghaharas. The word k치ra켻a comes from the Sanskrit root kr which means 랎o do. So k치ra켻as were the rudimental actions as they were the units of Shiva뗩 Cosmic Tandava. Each k치ra켻a or unit is a combination of cari (leg movement) nrtta hastan (hand gestures) and stanam (bodily posture). Many k치ra켻a are called kalapakas, many kalapakas are called m치trik치s, many m치trik치s are called bhandakas, many bhandakas are called sanghataka and many sanghatakas are called angaharas. Anga means body or limb and Hara is a name of Shiva (One who forcibly steals the sins of His disciples). There are 32 angaharas and these are all practiced in South India and Thailand. The karanas are like words and the other categories are like sentences, paragraphs, sections, pages, chapters and books. More experimental research is required on Tandava to reveal the beauty of each of these karanas or units in our own daily dancing of Tandava. Just as the glory of Tandava\n\nTandava is a mandatory dance for all spiritual functions and processions as it is an indispensable aid in developing virility, vitality and courage and longevity. It is a vigorous dance for men that causes the stimulation of the adrenal cortex which stimulate the testes to start the production of male hormones. Since it causes therby the growth of facial hair and other male attributes, it is not for women.\n\nThe dancer holds a knife, sword, or torch or trident (trishula), lathi (fighting staff) or pinaka (Shiva뗩 tabor or small drum) in the right hand, symboliying the forces of life and goodness and a fire, a skull or snake in the left hand, symboliying the forces of death and darkness. The hands are kept straight at 90 degrees to the sides of the body. This represents the strength of arms of the dancer. The arms being kept firmly straight throughout this energetic dance represents that the dancer is ready to fight to the death. This dance is related to the struggle between the Cosmic forces of vidya (enlightenment and benevolence) and avidya (ignorance and malevolence). The dancer however, like his Lord, is beyond both forces and is concentrating on his lunar plexus between his eyebrows. To dance Tandava one must be in a state of surrender. Surrender means surrender of one뗩 entire body to His will, surrender of all one뗩 mind (all thoughts, feelings, intuitions, etc.) to the dust of His feet, surrender of one뗩 very soul (Atman) unto His heart. The deeper the surrender, the deeper will be the realization in Tandava. For Tandava is not an exercise or art-form, it is a revolutionary path to spiritual realization.\n\nFirstly the dancers stand on their toes, with both arms extended outwards from the side of the body at a 90 degree angle from the side of the chest. Then the dancers jump upwards with the feet kicking the back of the trunk of the body. Then dancers land on their toes in a squatting position. Then the dancers jump bringing the knees to the chest and then stand erect. Then the dancer should stand on the left leg, jump up and swing the right leg sideways to the left. Afterwards the right leg comes down and one lands on the right leg. Then the left leg is swung sideways to the right. Like this, one keeps on swinging each leg sideways moving faster and faster. When the dance is over again the dancers stand on tiptoe with arms extended sideways. Then the dancers jump bringing the knees to the chest and falling into a squatting position. Then one jumps up into a standing position with the arms outstretched sideways.\n\n#### Group Tandava\n\nDuring group Tandava a red coloured dress is used. B츼B츼 said that red is the colour of rajoguna (mutative factor creating action and passion). By wearing red the dancers are expressing the idea that they are above the mutative faction and established in the sattvaguna (sentient sphere).\n\nFor this dance there is a caller who calls out the instructions. There are two sounds used by the caller. Ta which is related to the hell of the foot. Dhiin which is related to be ball of the foot. The caller begins by saying, Dancers, ready!, at which point the dancers stand on their toes with arms fully stretched out on both sides. Then the caller cries out,  1  2  3, Jump! The dancers kick the back of their body trunk with their feet while jumping up and then land on their toes in a squatting position. Then the caller recites, Ta, ta, dhiin, ta뙉 while the dancers jump up, bringing their knees to the chest and land standing erect. Now the caller says, Ta, ta, dhiin, ta뙉 as the dancers stand of the right leg and jump up, swinging the right leg sideways to the left. And then, the caller intones, Ta, ta, dhiin, ta뙉 as the dancer lands on the right leg and jumping up on the right leg, swings the left leg towards the right. This moving back and forth from one leg to another continutes while getting more and more fast in response to the increasing speed of the Caller뗩 shouts. When the speed becomes great, then only the syllables of the kiirtan mantra B츼B츼 Nama Kevalam are used and not Ta or Dhiin. Finally, the Callers shouts, Dancers, halt! at which point the dancers stop and stand erect. Then the Caller says, Final pose, at which point the dancers jump, bringing the knees to the chest and land in a squatting position.\n\n#### Benefits of Tandava\n\n1.  Imparts tremendous bravery and will power.\n2.  Improves capacity for deep thinking.\n3.  Removes doubt and indecisiveness from the mind.\n4.  Conquers defeatist complex.\n5.  Overcomes fear complex.\n6.  Endows one with a fighting spirit.\n7.  Conquers laziness and sloth.\n8.  Imparts youthfulness and vigour.\n9.  Exercises the brain and nerve cells. Improves memory.\n10.  Makes the mind one-pointed and concentrated.\n11.  Strengthens the heart. Improves circulation and respiration.\n12.  Is the only exercise for the internal organs of the body.\n13.  Paves the way for physical development, mental elevation and spiritual progress.\n14.  Increases secretion of male hormones from the testes glands which enhances male characteristics such as body hair, voice, bones and muscle but also leads to the development of universal and and the desire to do something for humanity.  \n    The longer the time one stays off the ground while jumping, the more and more benefits will be absorbed by the dancer and when the dancer touches the ground, those benefits are assimilated into the body. For the best results in Tandava,\n\n-   the arms should be stretched sideways and be kept sompletely straight throughout the dance.\n-   kick the knees as high as possible.\n-   kick the foot as far as possible to the left and then to the right and so on.\n-   jump two times on either foot\n-   dance on the balls of the feet and if possible dance only on the toes or big toes.\n-   don뗪 turn the waist or torso as one dances.\n-   wear a lungota or special yogic underwear so as to protect the genitals from damage. if this is not possible then wear and athletic support used by sportsmen\n\nTandava is the cosmic dance that merges one with the Macrocosmic Nucleus (Supreme Subjectivity or Shiva. This is the true realtiy of Tandava beyond the physical benefits of exercise of the brain and inner organs and the revitilization of bodily systems and the psychic benefits of confidence, courage to fight an army and ardent caring for the suffering humanity. To do Tandava is in itself a revolutionary act. It is a declaration of war against one뗩 animality, mediocrity and cowardice (both external and spiritual) and after these have been defeated in one뗩 inner psyche, it becomes a declaration of war against these pathologies in the collective psychology. To pursue Tandava in one뗩 external life even when one is not dancing is the path of nuclear revolution or a revolution in each and every sphere of life. Such persons strike fear in the hearts of exploiters and those who compromise with them and such persons ignite jubilation in the heart of suffering humanity.\n\nB츼B츼 has said that all beings of this universe are circling around Him  the nucleus of the Macrocosm. And this circling is in fact a veritable dance of the divine play of the Flow of bliss (rasa-liila). This circling is undulating due to the ever-changing blissful flows of enchantment emanating from that Beloved or B츼B츼. And B츼B츼 says that when in this Cosmic Dance, the waves become gigantic (when one undergoes intense heartache and intense union in a fraction of a second), then this is known as the Tandava dance. On our planet we are moving deeper and deeper into a Tandava era in which there will be so much destruction as a punishment for the crimes of humanity against each other and their brothers and sisters animals and plants. But at the same time there will be intense sadhana, selfless service and radiant sacrifice. And out of this perfect storm a new humanity will emerge. Tandava began with prehistoric men who were largely animalistic and homicidal and transformed those men into gods in our era society is largely animalistic and omnicidal and by B츼B츼뗩 Cosmic Tandava, by our transmission of it through our surrender, a divine society will be created. This is the mission of Lord Anandamurti and His Tandava.\n\nThere are three types of Tandava. When the knees cross the navel it is called Brahma Tandava as this creates so much energy and courage to start new projects that no one has done before. While doing this type of Tandava, the best and natural point of concentration is the A뗡ina Cakra or lunar plexus between the two eyebrows. The word A뗡ina means command and when the mind is at this cakra one can receive the Guru뗩 command and when one is doing Tandava while concentrating at this cakra one will become merge with the command of the Guru and become a true disciple. When the knees cross the mid-point of the chest it is known as Visnu Tandava as this creates a deep flow of wisdom and love to administrate, nourish and expand so many people and programmes. While doing this type of Tandava, concentration starts at the Ajina Cakra but then moves upward to Bindu near the back of the head.  \nB츼B츼 has said that this centre is the real Varanasi or holy city of Shiva where if one dies, one is not reborn in this world. When one does Tandava concentrating at this centre with surrender can cause a bursting and then entrance into the world of na뗛a or the realm of divine sound and Cosmic Knower-I (mahat). Then by merging in this flow of divine sound one becomes a medium (Bhairava) by which this divine sound can be transmitted on earth. When the knees cross the throat it is called Rudra Tandava as this creates a tremendous burst of surrender and revolutionary power to first, crush the exploiters and make them weep for mercy and second to infuse the weeping, suffering humanity with determination to fight for liberation and with the divine love that brings tears of bliss.\n\nWhile doing this type of Tandava, concentration starts at Bindu and then moves towards the Macropropensitive Plexus or Sahasrara Cakra at the centre of the crown of the head. This cakra is where true enlightenment and true existence is found and this is why it is said that any state of being below this cakra is maya or illusion. Now when one does Tandava concentrating at this point one goes into deep, deep bliss and if there is purity, then there is a bursting like a great lake bursting through a rock and then comes the dazzling, effulgent ether or sky of Consciousness (cida뗢a뗩ha) and then for those who are interested in only loving Him, there appears above the Sahasrara the far more blinding radiance of His Feet revealed more beauteously and sublimely than in the Guru Cakra or Occult Plexus. Those who have experienced this will say, B츼B츼 Pada hi Kevalam (B츼B츼 Feet are Everything, are the sole Reality). These are the normal forms of Tandava but the superhuman form of Sadashiva Tandava is to bring the knee above the centre-point between the eyebrows or third eye. While doing this type of Tandava the concentration naturally moves from the Sahasrara Cakra into the dust of B츼B츼뗩 Feet. This causes one to merge in the Cosmic Stance of the Lord as the creator, sustainer and destroyer of the inifinite entities of the universe. This leads to the trance of ideterminate absorption (savikalpa Samadhi) in Qualified Consciousness (Saguna Brahma) or the Macrocosm or the Cosmic Nucleus (Supreme Subjectivity). The utterly divine form of Ananda or Mahadeva Tandava is to bring the knee above the head itself.\n\nWhile doing this Tandava the mind starts in the Sahasrara Cakra and then moves to merge in B츼B츼뗩 Feet. Then one becomes a part of B츼B츼 and as per His boundless love one will be graced with infinite liilas (divine plays) in which there is no duality but rather intimacy in the highest state of unity. This causes one to merge in the absolute bliss (nityananda) of the Godhead. This leads to the trance of indeterminate absorption (Nirvikalpa Samadhi) with the effulgence of Non-qualified Consciousness (Nirguna Brahma). For those who are ardent devotees, who long only to love, there lies there opens the stance of absolute union with that Supreme Liberator or Taraka Brahma (Taraka Brahma Samadhi) from whence comes merger with the very core of the Non-qualified Consciousness. Here the point of concentration naturally starts in Vrindavan or the centre of madhura bhava (intimate love) and moves to other places like Kuinjavan (the place from where He sends out His divine loving call), Nidhuvan or Nidhivan (the place of absolute union with the Beloved) and so much more. This latter category of people unites with their Supreme Beloved in both low and high levels of Tandava for love is beyond all levels.\n\nNow the reader may ask what is the social importance of this Tandava? Firstly, by doing Tandava even for a short time creates a surge of power and confidence in oneself such that one feels one can fight an army. Secondly Shrii Sarkar has said that if a group of people do Tandava in public with skull and knife, even the most cowardly person who sees this will feel a surge of courage. Hence before starting any movement or revolutionary action, collective Tandava in public is vital to success. For it is the common people who must rise up and liberate themselves from the economic dictatorship of the capitalists.\n\n![](http://proutglobe.org/wp-content/uploads/tandava.jpg)\n\nThe process of dancing tandava 1-8\n\n#### 3rd Lesson\n\nTo attain such states of advanced spirituality through the purification of Bhaeravii Shakti requires total self control or cakra niyantra켻a. This involves full control over the vrttis or propensities associated with each cakra. Otherwise one뗩 meditation and one뗩 ideation in daily life will remain disturbed by these inner weaknesses. For this very reason, the 3rd Lesson of Ananda Marga Sahaja Yoga was given. Let us briefly examine it.\n\n**Understanding the Third Lesson  \n(TATTVA DH츼RA켺츼 or Cakra Niyantra켻a)**  \nBy Acarya Cidghanananda Avadhuta\n\nThis is one of most misunderstood lessons of Ananda Marga sadhana. Firstly let us be clear about the meaning of the name of this lesson. Tattva is defined by Baba as follows,\n\n\u003e In Sanskrit, tat means 랎hat. Here That means Parama Puru콑a. For Parama Puru콑a, Param치tm치 or Parama Brahma it is [normal] usage to use It as neutral gender. Neither masculine nor feminine, neuter gender. So here the word He has not been used, the word That has been used. Tat means That, and tva is [a suffix to make] an abstract noun [meaning 랉ess렣. So Tattva means Thatness. [The] State of being of Parama Purusa.렢n\u003e \n\u003e  The Causal Matrix\n\nAnd\n\n\u003e The word tattva means 랎he bh치va [essence or existence] of the essential root entity hidden within every entity. Tattvadra콑t패치 means 랊ne who sees tattva through supreme knowledge.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Discourse 20, Shabda Cayanik치 Part 3\n\nThe word Dh치ra켻치 is normally understood to mean 띾oncentration. This English word comes from the Latin prefix 띾om meaning 랎ogether and the Latin word 띾entrum or centre. So the word literally means to come together at the centre. Meditation is nothing but a spiritually charged process of concentration.\n\n#### Why This Lesson is Crucial\n\nThere are some who are devotees who ignore this lesson thinking it has to do with occult powers and there are some who are lower yogis and hence pursue with the same opinion.  \nThis lesson seems to involve concentration on various rudimental levels (tattvas) of physical reality that are called bh칰tas. According to the Tantric theory of creation the entire physical is comprised of these 5 rudimental factors, namely, the solid factor, the liquid factor, the luminous factor, the aerial factor and the ethereal factor. As Baba explains,\n\n\u003e In this connection it should be understood that the philosophical term bh칰ta is different from the scientific term 란lement. The Sa拷쯥krta equivalent for element is maolika pad치rtha. Philosophically, bh칰ta means that which has been created, that which is recognized as a factor (tattva). In the world there are many elements, but only five bh칰tas, five fundamental factors.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Struggle and Progress\n\nIn reality our mind experiences the world by indirect contact with the bhutas. So the mind is always being conditioned or coloured by our experiences of the bhutas in daily life. This is why these experiences must be controlled and purified for our sadhana to progress. Baba explains how our mind is shaped by the bhutas saying,\n\n\u003e In order to take the form of any object, citta (mind-stuff) grasps its tanm치tra (sensory inference) and first becomes like the rudimental factor (bh칰ta) or the state of matter of which the object is made. For instance on seeing a book, the citta grasps the r칰pa (figure-forming) tanm치tra, and before being able to take the form of the book properly, it has to become like the substance or the state of matter of which the book is made. If the book is made of paper, which falls in the k콑ititattva or the solid state of matter, the citta will have to become like paper or k콑ititattva before it can take the form of the book. Therefore, it is necessary for citta to become like the tattva or bh칰ta (rudimental factor) of which its object is made. Then alone will it be able to take a complete and proper shape.\n\u003e \n\u003e  What is This World\n\nThe property of citta to become like its object is called dh치ran치 which means 랎o hold: the citta holds an image and becomes like that. In concentration on external objects, the images are static and not in a continuous flow. When one is concentrating within on the different images of Third Lesson, then it can become a continuously flow depending on whether we are also ideating on Baba in the centre of each cakra. When a devotee practices during this practice he or she will have one thought uppermost in his/her mind  that the Entity on whom he/she is ideating is his nearest relation, and no one is nearer to him than her/his Lord. Because of this, a devotee뗩 mind will become highly expanded in a short period.  \nWe know from the definition of Tattva given above, that there is only one Tattva or Reality. However, in our daily life and sometimes even in our sadhana there seem to be many realities.  \nIn First lesson we are withdrawing from the secondary tattvas (realities) and coming to a place where we adore with our mantra, our Ista (Ideational Desideratum or Goal) who is the real Tattva. In Second lesson, in our daily life we are moving towards this realization by ideating upon that Ista Tattva in all we see, hear, smell, etc. So sadhana means moving towards this oneness where there is only pure oneness or Tattva. Baba explains this saying,\n\n\u003e You are a s치dhaka [aspirant]. He is the s치dhya [object of adoration]. And the link is s치dhan치 [spiritual practice]. As long as these three tattvas [realities] exist, you are not He. When all three have become one, one may say I am Param치tm치 [Supreme Self]  never prior to this. Until this stage is reached, one has to do s치dhan치 most diligently, with greatest ni콑t패ha [adamantine adherence or zeal].\n\u003e \n\u003e  The Dialogues of Shiva and P치rvatii  1\n\nWhat is the root of this worldly state of Consciousness that keeps us involved in duality and that prevents the perfection of our 1st and 2nd lessons? The answer is the five root realities of the physical realm. Now, in the human body, these rudimental factors are centred at the 5 lower cakras. And it is based on these cakras that the entire matrix of propensities that underlies the existence of our mind is based. This is why this lesson is also called Cakra Niyantra켻a or the controlling of the cakras. Niyantra켻a is a word formed first by the prefix 랉i meaning 띿own, back, in, into, within. The word yantra is comprised of the word 랓am meaning 랎o control and the verb 랎rae which means 랎o liberate. So yantra means that which when controlled liberates. Then, Cakra Niyantrana means to control the cakras by bringing the mind down within to their centre and liberating oneself thereby.\n\nDh치ra켻치 is translated as 띾ollection or concentration of the mind (joined with the retention of breath), or 랎he act of holding, bearing, wearing, supporting, maintaining, retaining, keeping back (in remembrance), a good memory, or 랁irmness, steadfastness, certainty. This term is related to the verbal root dhri meaning 랎o hold, carry, maintain, resolve.렢n\n#### Understanding the Cakras\n\nSo the aim of Third Lesson is not the attainment of siddhis or occult powers but rather coming to the centre of the ultimate Reality or Tattva who is manifest within each cakra. This is why Baba defines Dharana as follows,\n\n\u003e Dh치ra켻치 is defined as: Deshabandhashcittasya dh치ra켻치. Dh치ra켻치 literally means 랇ocating the mind firmly in an area or region of the body. This involves concentrating upon the respective controlling points of the fundamental factors located within the human body. That is, the mind is to be fixed on specific cakras [plexi] and engaged in Cosmic ideation.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Questions and Answers on Meditation\n\nLet us review what Baba has said about each cakra in the discourse S치lokya, S치miipya, S치yujya, S치r칰pya, S치r콑t패hi (츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 33):\n\n\u003e Muladhara (The mid-point of the last vertebra of the spinal column): The colour visible here is the golden yellow of the earth and the sound is like the tick-tick of the cricket. The shape is square.  \n\u003e Svadhisthana (on the spinal cord directly behind the root of the male genital organ): The sound resembles that of the p치yala, bells affixed to a dancer뗩 legs. The colour is a watery white and the shape the half-moon.  \n\u003e Manipura (on the spinal cord directly behind the navel): The sound is like a sweet flute, the colour is red, and the shape is triangular.  \n\u003e Anahata (situated in the centre of the chest): The shape is hexagonal or circular. The colour is first blue and then greenish. The sound resembles that of a [gong] or at times that of the sea.  \n\u003e Vishuddha (located in the region of the throat): There is no particular shape and there is a mixture of various colours. The earlier sounds of bell, flute and sea develop into the beginning of the sound o攷긄, and this becomes clearer and clearer until the full-fledged o攷긄 sound comes at last.렢n\nIn the article on The Acoustic Roots of the Indo-Aryan Alphabet, Baba says,\n\n\u003e La is also the acoustic root of k콑ititattva, the solid factor.  \n\u003e Va is also the acoustic root of jalatattva [the liquid factor]  \n\u003e Ra is the acoustic root of agnitattva [luminous factor] or pr치켻ashakti  vitality  \n\u003e Ya뵬s also the acoustic root of constant movement (like the movement of ether)렢n\n#### Goal of Third Lesson\n\nBaba explains clearly what is the difference between Avidya Tantra and Vidya Tantra regarding the sadhana on the cakras in the discourse Mahasambhuti Krsna, saying,\n\n\u003e Depending upon the difference in the controlling points of the cakras, spiritual s치dhan치 can take either of two forms: (1) Controlling the hormone secretion of the glands and strengthening the controlling points of the cakras is the system known as hatha yoga, because it is more physical in character. This science is more extroversive in character and consequently part of avidya tantra. (2) To surrender one뗩 mind to Shrii Kr콑켻a  This is introversive or ideational in character and is part of Vidy치 Tantra. This is the real s치dhan치, where the entire psycho-physical entity surrenders itself to Parama Puru콑a  \n\u003e Kr콑켻a utilizes the pituitary gland [츼ji攷치 cakra] of any human framework. Whenever a direct contact between Kr콑켻a and the unit mind is established, human beings attain salvation. For this the mind must be absolutely pure. In certain different stages aji攷그 cakra comes in contact with Parama Puru콑a. Kr콑켻a controls the centre and the sub-centres both directly and indirectly. Param치tman Kr콑켻a controls all the pure spiritual ideation, and Jiiv치tman Kr콑켻a controls psycho-spiritual ideations. For s치dhakas, the only mission is to surrender at the feet of Lord Kr콑켻a by strengthening the physical sub-centres. He maintains His association with the microcosms either as Mah치sambh칰ti or as Cosmic Nucleus.\n\nSo avidya tantra means working to control the cakras to get powers, knowledge, realization or gurudom. Sadly many so-called vidya tantrics follow this parth. However, true Vidya Tantra means controlling the cakras so as to 1) surrender the mind to Baba and 2) Have Baba come and take control over one뗩 cakras and one뗩 mind and body. So Third Lesson we see is in fact a sadhana for devotees. To understand why we have to briefly look at what Baba says about the devotional samadhis that one attains when the cakras are fully controlled.\n\n#### Process of Third Lesson\n\nThere is a special posture known as Viir치sana (brave pose) which is given. This brave posture is very scientifically prescribed, because in no other posture is one able to focus the mind with the strength and power one is able to generate in this posture. Therefore this posture has been selected because it is best suited to bring about the most positive results.\n\nThere are some people who feel some pain in the head when first beginning to do this lesson. This is for two reasons: firstly, the body is not able to tolerate the force generated, and secondly, the body is in an impure state. By following the instructions of the 치c치rya from the beginning and continually doing the lesson, one is able to conquer the pain.\n\nIn Third Lesson we are ideating as taught on the cakra and then concentrating on the core of the cakra and reciting mantra. The mantras seem to talk of occult powers. However the Sanskrit language is very rich and has multiple meanings. By His Grace the devotee realizes more and more subtle and devotional meanings of these mantras. Furthermore for the devotee the goal is to give control over each cakra to Him as part of the complete internal surrender unto Him. In that case occult powers are what He displays through the body of the devotee to establish His Mission.\n\nA true devotee will take the time to study the mantras understanding the root meaning of each word. Some say they are devotees and will not study this. However they will gladly study the different varieties of mobiles or sweets. But Baba clearly says,\n\n\u003e Regarding thinking with concentration, that is, meditation  it is another, still subtler, science. Meditation should be performed knowing fully well the location of different glands and sub-glands and also the different cells in the human brain. And people should not only know the location of these glands and sub-glands, they should also be acquainted with their respective systems of hormone secretion, otherwise their meditation will not produce any fruit. So for this system of meditation, knowledge of biology is essential.\n\u003e \n\u003e  The Mind Grows in Magnitude\n\nNow as we are reciting the mantra in a particular Cakra we are surrdering to Baba in the centre of each cakra. And when our devotion blossoms we will be graced with the vision of Baba in His special form for each cakra. This is part of what is called Mahasambhuti Sadhana.\n\nFor example it is well known that in the Muladhara Cakra one will see a resplendent golden lion. Above the head of that golden lion with be an unbelievably bright dot of light. Within that dot will be found Lord Anandamurti.\n\nIn this way devotees experience special bliss in each cakra by Third Lesson. For in fact Baba will also manifest in a unique way in each petal of the cakras. In Dharana the actions and bhavas of the Ista submerge the meditator. Baba is continually radiating so many liilas and bhavas (ecstatic expressions) in each petal of each cakra and upacakra (subcakras). Those who are devotees become lost in this endless world of divine beauty. Those who are premis (devoted to loving Him) they become lost in loving Him in each and every way He expresses Himself. So to have His darshan in whichever way one moves in the internal realm is true Dharana.\n\n#### From Concentration to Union\n\nThe human mind is moving towards so many propensities; there are so many propensities in the human mind; and according to the complexity in the mind, the physical body also becomes more and more complex. The physical structure of an animal is less complex than that of a human being, because the human mind is also more complex than that of the animal. The number of glands in a human body is more than that in an animal structure, in an animal body. Now the first phase of the process is physico-psychic  that is, withdrawing the mind from different physical objects and bringing it to a particular point, and directing that point towards the realm of mind. And next is a phase of withdrawing the mind from different mental objects, from different mental pabula, and directing it towards the Supreme Subjectivity. Now this process of movement is the process of concentration.\n\nComplete withdrawal of mind from its manifestations is concentration of mind, but it is not annihilation of mind. The restless mind which begins the process of s치dhan치 can be calmed down through regular practice. Ultimately a state is reached when the mind flows undisturbed in one direction. This state is called ek치gra bh칰mi (state of concentration). As one progresses one eventually attains the state of nirodha or suspension of mind. One must reach the state of mental concentration (ek치gra) before attaining sam치dhi. Most people are well acquainted with the fourth state of mind (ek치gra).\n\nIn this state the human mind sometimes becomes exalted with divine sweetness; and sometimes becomes as debased as an infernal creature. Sometimes it keeps company with good people and takes a resolve never to tell lies, accept bribes, get intoxicated, or become characterless; and sometimes it thinks that honesty and virtue are sheer folly, for happiness lies in falsehood, taking bribes, stealing, promiscuity, and the like. The mind is continuously tossed between good and bad. But when the practice of s치dhan치 inspires one to accept shreya (path of benevolence) as one뗩 ideology, one attains the true state of ek치gra bh칰mi. In this state waves upon waves of citta emerge but merge into one flow.\n\nThe hand counts the beads, the lips mutter the name of the I콑t패a, but the mind roams in the filth of hell. However, when all the undesirable waves are removed from the mind, one blissful wave begins to flow, and the s치dhaka attains the state of ek치gra bh칰mi.\n\nWhen all the vrttis of the citta are focused on a single point it is termed the state of concentration (ek치grabh칰mi). This, however exhalted, is not the ultimate state. The ultimate state is reached when the mind transcends all citta-vrttis (mental propensities) and merges in the Beloved.\n\nNow Dharana is the highest form of yoga after Dhyana. Why? Because when done by a devotee, the mind automatically become suspended and merged (nirodha) in Supreme Consciousness. This Dharana develops the Vijananamaya Kosa or the subliminal layer of the mind-stuff (citta). Then, the capacity for discrimination (based on five kinds of conscience) and detachment (by colouring one뗩 mind with the colour of the Beloved) develop in the sadhaka. This all starts with contemplating the colours and properties of each cakra and then concentrating on the beauties of Baba뗩 Form and liilas in each cakra and finally it culminates in one뗩 surrendering everything unto Him in each and every way He expresses Himself in each cakra. Then Third Lessson becomes a festival of Union as one merges in Him in millions of ways in each cakra.\n\n#### From Union to Communion\n\nFrom combinations of the five bhutas emerge the countless entities of the created world. In this sense then all created beings are Bhutas. And our Dharma on this Earth, in this universe is nothing but to serve these Bhutas. As Baba says,\n\n\u003e Bh칰ta Yaji攷그 means services rendered to any created entity of the manifested world. For example, watering trees, serving cattle, undertaking scientific explorations and doing anything for the sake of welfare. In Sa拷쯥krta, Bh칰ta means that which has been created  \n\u003e Inculcate divine sentiment by saturating love wherever you have to perform Bh칰ta Yaji攷그뵐t is meaningless to love out of fear. Where there is no love, there cannot be complete surrender of the self and the yaji攷그 (service) is fruitless.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Yajina and Karmaphala\n\nIn spiritual parlance, when the mental flow is directed towards the goal, that is, the Supreme Entity, it is called 띾oncentration, but in metaphysical terms, it is a concept of dharma. Concentrated thinking leads to the development of positive ideas and occult powers in the process of constant mental flow towards the goal.  \nBecause of our lack of control over the bhutas (solid, liquid, luminous, aerial and ethereal factors) within us, we do not have pure love for all the beings of this universe. Hence we are unable to establish the rule of sublime righteousness (Dharma Rajya). So by Third Lesson we are learning to develop the capacity to give selfless service. Furthermore by surrender unto Him we develop the capacity to perform the Tattva Dharana or the collective mind to liberate our society from slavery to selfish exploitation of the material world created from the bhutas. When this happens we will attain the final Communion or merger of all in His love that Baba mentioned in one of the last discourses,\n\n\u003e So in this phase of introversial movement, when crude physicality is being transmuted into psychic, we can expect that the day is sure to come when the whole world will move from the subtle psychic realm and cross the threshold of the still more subtle spiritual world. And that day when the entire living world  dashing through a transitory phase of psychic  will become spiritual will not be in the distant future.  \n\u003e The eternal game (liil치) of Parama Puru콑a is in process (when we do not know the cause of something we call it liil치 and when we discover the cause we call it kriid패치); and due to this eternal game of Parama Puru콑a, matter is converted into mind, and mind into consciousness, and finally unit consciousness into Supreme Consciousness. That is, first the One becomes many and then the many ultimately become One. Parama Puru콑a certainly showers His grace upon the microcosmic beings, because they have all emerged from His Macrocosmic thought-waves. And in the final stage of His Cosmic thought-waves, He absorbs all the individual microcosms into His vast Macrocosmic body. The microcosms emerge from Him and finally merge back into Him.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Biological Transformation Associated with Psychic Metamorphosis and Vice Versa\n\n#### 4th Lesson\n\nFor perfect control over the cakras, one requires full control over one뗩 mind. To have control over at least the extroversial part of the mind that causes the most distraction we require to control our breathing which is connected with our life force called Pr치켻a. This spiritual practice is often misunderstood so let us examine some of the main questions that people have.\n\nUnderstanding the Fourth Lesson\n\n1.  What is pr치켻치y치ma?  \n    Pr치켻치y치ma is defined as: Tasmin sati shv치sa prashv치sayoh gativicchedah pr치켻치y치ma. That is, Pr치켻치y치ma is the process of breath control along with the imposition of the ideation of Supreme Consciousness. It helps the mind in concentration and meditation.  \n    The special effort whereby the normal flow of inhalation and respiration is altered and a temporary cessation of respiration is introduced by special means, is called pr치켻치y치ma.렢n2.  What is the spirit of pr치켻치y치ma?  \n    Pr치n치n yamayati e콑ah pr치켻치y치mah. That is, the word pr치켻치y치ma literally means 띾ontrolling the pr치켻치h [vital energy]. The psycho-philosophy behind the practice of pr치켻치y치ma is that the spiritual aspirant tries to let the pr치켻endriya [ten vital-energy currents] remain in a state of pause so that the paused unit mind will merge into the ocean of consciousness.렢n3.  What is pr치켻a?  \n    The force which plays a special role in balancing the interial and exterial forces within the structure [like a body] is called pr치켻a. In this struggle if the opposing exterial forces are dominant the material structure collapses, and we declare it as dead.  \n    When the life force, due to the complexity of the structure, takes the unit mind as the apparent source of its actual flow, that is called life or vital energy (pr치켻치h). Pr치켻치h is the collection of ten vayus뵚he microcosm which guides its entire structure with pr치켻치h is called a living being.렢n4.  What are the 10 vayus?  \n    There are ten different internal and external v치yus. The internal v치yus are pr치켻a, ap치na, sam치na, ud치na, and vy치na.  \n    1) Pr치켻a: The pr치켻a v치yu is situated in the area from the navel to the throat. It helps with the respiratory functions and the circulation of vital energy.  \n    2) Ap치na: This v치yu functions in the area from the navel down. It helps in the excretion of urine and stool.  \n    3) Sam치na: Sam치na v치yu is situated at the navel region and maintains equilibrium between the pr치켻a and ap치na v치yus.  \n    4) Ud치na: The ud치na v치yu is situated in the throat. It helps in vocalization and expression of thought. If someone uses very emotional language we say 랎ini ud치tta ka켻the 치hv치n J치n치len. [He issued a clarion call.]  \n    5) Vy치na: The vy치na v치yu functions throughout the body. It helps in the circulation of vital fluids and blood, and in the perception and non-perception of experience.  \n    The five external v치yus are:  \n    1) N치ga: It resides in the joints. This n치ga v치yu helps with jumping and extending the body.  \n    2) K칰rma: It is found in the different glands of the body. K칰rma v치yu helps with the action of contraction. The way a turtle contracts by withdrawing its limbs into its body is called k칰rmabh치va. Since this v치yu helps in effecting k칰rmabh치va, it is called k칰rma v치yu  \n    3) Krkara: Krkara v치yu is scattered throughout the body. It expresses itself in the increase or decrease of air pressure. Krkara v치yu helps in yawning and stretching. Ordinarily, yawning happens right before falling asleep, and stretching, right after waking up  \n    4) Devadatta: The devadatta v치yu bases its action on the increased or decreased pressure of food and water in the stomach. Devadatta v치yu rouses thirst and hunger.  \n    5) Dhanai攷긁aya: As a result of internal or external labour, the body feels the need for sleep. The feeling of sleep or drowsiness comes from this dhanai攷긁aya v치yu which pervades the body, and so the living being drowses or falls asleep.  \n    Due to illness, old age or an unexpected injury, the region inhabited by pr치켻a v치yu degenerates and the pr치켻a v치yu can no longer maintain its natural functional capacity and flow. In this unnatural condition it strikes against the sam치na v치yu causing the sam치na v치yu to lose its equilibrium. As a result, the navelly-situated sam치na v치yu and the upper body pr치켻a v치yu quit their respective areas and merge; the two then create pressure on ap치na v치yu. In this condition the ud치na v치yu loses its normal ability to function under the united pressure of pr치켻a, sam치na and ap치na. This condition we call 랉avel breathing. As a result of the ud치na v치yu losing its normal functioning, a rattling sound is produced in the throat. This is an indication of imminent natural death.  \n    At the time of leaving the body, the four united v치yus  pr치켻a, ap치na, sam치na, and ud치na  join with the vy치na v치yu, which is present throughout the body. These five vital forces, having become one, leave the body and join the aerial factor or merge in Mah치pr치켻a [Cosmic Life]. At the time that the pr치켻a v치yu leaves the body, four of the five external v치yus, namely n치ga, devadatta, k칰rma, and krkara, join with the pr치켻a v치yu and leave the body together with it. Only the dhanai攷긁aya v치yu remains in the body.  \n    Sleep and drowsiness is the work of dhanai攷긁aya v치yu. The body being in a state of permanent repose, dhanai攷긁aya v치yu remains. After cremation, or when the dead body completely decomposes in the grave, dhanai攷긁aya enters the mah치bh칰ta [five fundamental factors] and merges into the aerial factor.  \n    The collective name of the five internal v치yus and five external v치yus is the five pr치켻as or the ten pr치켻as.렢n5.  What is vayu?  \n    The universe is the thought-projection of the Cosmic Mind. The influence of rajogu켻a (mutative principle) creates a thought-wave in the Aha拷쯦attva [doer-I or ego] of Sagu켻a Brahma, and its objective counterpart, citta [done-I, ectoplasm, mind-stuff], assumes the form of the crude universe. Citta is subtle in nature, but it has to become crude like the creation. In order to become crude citta has to gradually take on the form of the five tattvas or rudimental factors, that is, vyomatattva or 치k치sha (ethereal), maruttattva or v치yu (aerial), tejastattva or agni (luminous), jalatattva (liquid) and k콑ititattva (solid) After taking the form of 치k치sha tattva [ethereal factor], citta manifested itself as v치yu. V치yu (air) is cruder than 치k치sha (ether) as in this we find the presence of two tanm치tras. Air or v치yu has the tanm치tra of shabda (sound) as well as that of sparsha (touch). We would not be able to hear each other talk if air did not contain the shabda (sound) tanm치tra. Ordinarily sound-waves are carried from place to place by the air, thus the presence of shabda (sound) tanm치tra is essential. We only feel the presence of air by touch and so sparsha (touch) tanm치tra is also present. Thus we find two tanm치tras in v치yu (aerial factor), while in 치k치sha or the ethereal factor there is only one tanm치tra. V치yu, the aerial factor, is, therefore, cruder than 치k치sha, and has come into being after the ethereal factor.렢n6.  How do these vayus emerge?  \n    The life or vital energy of human beings is the coordinated functioning of the ten vayus. As these vayus are one of the fundamental factors (the aerial factor) in the extroversive flow of the Cosmic imagination, it can be said that vital energy is created and vibrated by the Cosmic imagination.  \n    Let us see how life gets expression within the physical unit structure. These physical structures are composed of five fundamental factors  ethereal, aerial, luminous, liquid and solid  and so, for their own existence as unit structures, they must have the controlling nuclei of the respective factors within their composite body. All these factors should remain in requisite proportion, and on the mutual cohesion amongst these factors depends the resultant interial, or the pr치켻치h. The controlling nucleus of all these fundamental physical nuclei is the controlling point of the collective pr치켻a. This collection of pr치켻a is called pr치켻치h or 랐ital energy.  \n    The wear and tear within a physical structure results in the deficiency of some factor or other and may also tell upon the resultant activity controlling the subjective nucleus and maintaining structural solidarity. Now if the deficiency caused thereby is not adequately compensated, and if the requisite proportion of any factor or factors is not met, the resultant interial will begin varying in intensity; and the unit structure may lose its solidarity. Logically, therefore, it may be concluded that for the physical unit structure an environment is essentially required where all these five fundamental factors are available in requisite quantity. Life can get expression only under such a condition. For the manifestation of life, therefore, a congenial atmosphere is a fundamental necessity. Hence it may be concluded that the resultant interial force expressing itself into life under a congenial environment is what is known as pr치켻치h or vital energy. In Sanskrit this term is always used in the plural number, because it is a collection of ten v치yus, or ten important forces, working within or without the physical structure.  \n    During the mental process of extrovert and introvert, there is always a clash within the physical body due to the external pressure of static Prakrti. The resultant interial and exterial forces working within the physical structure are known as pr치켻a; and the cooperative activity of the ten v치yus  five interial and five exterial (pr치켻a, ap치na, sam치na, ud치na and vy치na; and n치ga, k칰rma, krkara, devadatta and dhanai攷긁aya)  is known as pr치켻치h.렢n7.  How does Pranayama affect all the five internal vayus directly and indirectly?  \n    Pranayama affects the whole area (vishuddha [throat] to manipura [navel]) in which prana vayu is active. From the navel to the anus there is the region in which apana vayu is active and samana vayu acts as a buffer to balance these two forces. When we inhale the expanding prana vayu puts pressure on the samana vayu and this causes the compressed apana vayu to push back. When we exhale the shrinking prana vayu causes less pressure to be put on the samana vayu and hence the apana vayu expands. This causes the compressed prana vayu to push back. Udana vayu in the throat is affected by the inhaling and exhaling but udana vayu is more subtle and is associated with the expression of sound throughout the physical body. It helps to control the flow of liquids in the body that produces sound. The act of inhaling and exhaling significantly impacts the flow of blood, lymph, etc. Vyana is a very subtle vayu and is affected by spiritual pranayama and helps to rapidly purify a person.\n8.  When is prana strongest in one뗩 life?  \n    Normally between the ages of sixteen and twenty-four human beings have abundant pr치켻a shakti [vital energy]. This is the period of their student life. Though there is plenty of vital energy during this period, due to intellectual underdevelopment the physical and intellectual waves are unable to adjust together properly. Hence those with a developed intellect, cunning political leaders, cast a net of high-sounding, illusory theories and exploit the vital energy of students to achieve their selfish political goals. Because of their underdeveloped intellect, the student community remains unaware of such exploitation.렢n9.  What is prana dharma or the collective prana?  \n    In this universe there are people whose thoughts, character and behaviour are similar  similar but not identical. Differences in human character and mentality, which are reflected in external human conduct, are due to varying propensities and tendencies. This is what accounts for the differences between people. Just as individual human beings have their distinctive characteristics, similarly, groups of people brought up in various geographical environments, historical eras, or cultural atmospheres, acquire their own group characteristics, too. Later those characteristics inherent in a particular group get mixed with the internal thoughts and ideas of other groups within a society. This leads to the development of national characteristics. In this way an entire national psychology  its external behaviour, its social outlook, and its philosophy of life  is developed. This process produces different national outlooks which distinguish one nation from another. It is also in this way that different human groups have developed different viewpoints towards life and the world. These differences are internal rather than external. Through proper education and well integrated social living in the individual and collective strata, internal qualities can be properly developed. Internal discipline in the psychic sphere of individual life is what we may call the Pr치켻a Dharma of individual life. When the national characteristics are expressed in a particular vein, we may call it the Pr치켻a Dharma of the nation.렢n10.  How can societies and cultures facing the onslaught of cultural, economic and political imperialism maintain their prana dharma?  \n    ㄹnandanagar [the author뗩 ecovillage in Purulia District, West Bengal, India] is the nucleus of this universe. It is not merely the physical Anandanagar, it is also the Anandanagar of our inner heart. We will have to build it in all possible ways, we will have to take all steps for its rapid development so that it can show light to the entire universe.  \n    But why should this be done so rapidly? Because human beings do not live by material objects alone; they also have their pr치켻a dharma (their vital inner essence). Even if they are provided with all their material needs  their food, clothes, and all necessary requirements, they will die an inglorious death if they are detached from their pr치켻a dharma. Anandanagar will provide that ancient eternal vital force. Thus it must be developed in all respects. This brooks no delay: to delay means to impair the cultural progress of the entire human society. We will not allow this to happen. Thus we must build Anandanagar in all ways.  \n    Anandanagar has a unique glory, and that glory has developed out of the great sacrifice of many noble souls. Let Anandanagar provide guidance to the entire universe in spiritual practice, service, sacrifice, renunciation, and culture. This is what we should pray for, and this is the reason that we should build Anandanagar and help it radiate light to the universal humanity. This is what I want.  \n    When for the benefit of human society, for human welfare, something has to be done which is not so easy to do, which is rarely done, which will deliver the necessary blow to the human race  when the right entity or being is needed to do this work  what will Parama Puru콑a do? He will create a body for Himself with the help of the five fundamental factors, and He will come. He will say, I will awaken the pr치켻a [vital energy] of these dying people with a timely slap, I will stir up their pr치켻a. He will create vibrations in their pr치켻a. He will not tolerate idleness. He will not allow us to waste this valuable human life.렢n11.  What is the science of breath and the vayus and who discovered it?  \n    Every day, every human being dies approximately twenty-four thousand times. The breath is taken in but not released, then it is released but not taken in. So everyone dies about twenty-four thousand times a day. But in what we actually call death, what happens is that once the breath has been released, it comes back again after an interval of one year, or one month, or one day, or one hundred thousand years  instead of one second. This is the only difference.  \n    One뗩 life is determined on the basis of a few pulsations, and these pulsations depend on a specific number of inhalations and exhalations. The number of such inhalations and exhalations  on average, from twenty-one thousand to twenty-five thousand per day  varies from person to person. The process of breathing has a great influence on the human mind and self, or soul.  \n    Suppose a person is running: his or her breathing immediately becomes heavy. In that condition he or she cannot think properly; the sensory organs such as the tongue, nose, etc., cannot function properly, and as a result one뗩 perception is impaired. Actions are performed during the period of expansion, and perception occurs during the period of contraction. In the state of motion the period of contraction becomes too short to allow any clear perception.  \n    Moreover, the process of breathing, depending upon whether the breath is flowing through the right nostril or the left nostril or both nostrils, influences people in various ways. It was Shiva [who lived 7500 years ago] who determined what kind of activity should be performed, depending on which nostril the breath was flowing through, and depending on whether the id패치 [left nadi or yogic channel] or piu攷귾al치 [right nadi or yogic channel] or su콑umn치 [central yogic channel through which the kundalini moves] channel was active. He set down specific rules and regulations as to when one should undertake physical, psychic or spiritual activities. He further instructed when and in what circumstances one should do 치sanas, pr치켻치y치ma, dh치ra켻치, dhy치na, etc. This science, which Shiva invented and developed, was known as svara sh치stra or svarodaya [science of breath control]. Prior to Him, the world was not aware of this science. Shiva also gave clear instructions how this science could be applied by people in the practical field of action.  \n    Besides these, He found the link between the exhalation and inhalation of breath on one side, and dance, song and instrumental music on the other. This is called Svara Sh치stra.렢n12.  Lord Krsna like Lord Shiva is known as Yogeshvara. Was Krsna also a master of pranayama?  \n    There is another very popular term and that one is Keshava. The word comes from Keshi. Keshi was the name of a mythological giant.  \n    Actually, what is keshi? Keshi is the respiratory organ in a disordered form. You know that the mind or mental concentration has a very close relationship with the respiratory organ. When the respiration is [disordered]  the inhalation or exhalation is very [disordered]  the mind becomes restless. When running, inhalation and exhalation are both very [disordered]. So in that state you cannot concentrate your mind. When running, your mind cannot be concentrated because of [disordered] inhalation and exhalation. To correct this, one should try to pause physically and the respiration should be brought under control. Respiration in a disorderly way or disorderly style is called keshi.  \n    Pr치켻치n yamayatye콑ah pr치켻치y치mah  By the process of pr치켻치y치ma one is to control the respiration, and when, by controlling the respiration, one is controlling the mental propensities, the mind will be concentrated. One can do it by a special process, and that system is to be strictly adhered to for proper control over the respiratory organ. And without this control, the mind cannot be concentrated, and without concentration of mind there can be no spiritual progress.  \n    The Lord by whose grace one establishes one뗩 control over the respiratory system is Keshava.  \n    Now during kiirtana what happens? The mind gets automatically concentrated. So kiirtana helps much in concentrating the mind. And if one who practices pr치켻치y치ma simultaneously practices kiirtana, he will get double the benefit. So Keshava, the Lord, Parama Puru콑a, always encourages kiirtana.렢n13.  What are some of the practical applications of this science?  \n    It is desirable to take food or to defecate when the main flow of breath is through the right nostril. Even after food, it is desirable if the flow of breath mainly through the right nostril continues for some time. Because that is the time when the digestive glands start secreting a sufficient quantity of fluids to help digestion.  \n    When doing a heavy job while breathing normally, a person might have serious difficulties  perhaps one뗩 limbs might be broken  but in a state of baddha kumbhaka, or p칰r켻a kumbhaka [with the lungs full], one can easily do the same work. While doing some over-strenuous activity in a state of sh칰nya kumbhaka [with the lungs empty] one might even die.  \n    Suppose you are climbing to a high place or lifting a very heavy load. If you do not follow the system of breathing while lifting the load, your hands may become painful or your bones dislocated. If you do the same work in a state of sh칰nya kumbhaka, you will have great difficulty  you may even collapse. If, on the contrary, you perform any strenuous activity in p칰r켻a kumbhaka, taking a deep breath, you can easily do it. All this comes within the scope of that svaraviji攷치na.  \n    If a person becomes agitated, causing his respiration to speed up, and his fists to close tightly the propensity (vrtti) of anger can easily get expressed. If this situation continues for long [, what will happen? Among the propensities of lust, anger, greed, vanity, attachment and jealousy,] anger will easily dominate the other propensities, and the hand indriya (in Sa拷쯥krta the palm is called p치켻i and its action is called shilpana) will become active resulting in him angrily slapping or punching another person.렢n14.  We all know the importance of breathing in our lives, but are we aware of prana at all?  \n    You are taking pr치켻a뗩 help every moment of your daily life. Just as you feel the heat or coldness of things through tactual inference or sparsha-tanm치tra, similarly you know their hardness and softness through pr치켻a. Suppose there is cotton and gold of equal temperature. The eye sensory organ will see them, the skin sensory organ will feel their hotness or coldness and the pr치켻a will feel the hardness of the gold and the softness of the cotton. The ear sensory organ will hear the song and the pr치켻a will appreciate its melody. The ears will hear the scandal and the pr치켻a will receive its harshness and severity; and thus hearing will become hurt and feel pain  it will hold anguish (dh치rya) in the mind. This capacity of the pr치켻a to hold feelings we call the vital core or marma. The terms 랃ard or 랍oft that you apply to a person on the basis of your knowledge of the hardness of iron or the fluidity of water are also derived from your pr치켻a-bodha or vital sense. A 랃ard man does not mean that the man is hard to touch. A 랃ard thought-wave is received by the pr치켻a when the skin-organ touches something hard. You call a man 랃ard only when his speech or behaviour creates a similarly hard thought-wave in your pr치켻a through the medium of any other organ. In the same manner you call many people 랍oft also, don뗪 you?  \n    What is this pr치켻a-bodha? I have already said that when the nerve or force of acceptance or rejection of inferences (tanm치tras) establishes contact between its object and the sthirabh칰mi or apperceptive plate of the citta, then alone does 랍ense come into being.렢n15.  If prana has this capacity to sense, then is it a kind of sense organ?  \n    The positions of the indriyas [ear, nose throat, tongue, skin, hands, feet, vocal cord, genital organ and excretory organ] are actually in the brain and not on the external surface of the physical body. There are gateways of the indriyas on the external surface of the physical body receiving tanm치tras emanated from different objects. The tanm치tras received through these gateways are converted into psychic objects according to the inherent sa拷쯥k치ras of the individuals. The position of pr치켻endriya is in the heart  not in the mechanical heart which palpitates but in the yogic centre of heart, that is, in the middle point of the an치hata cakra.  \n    During enumeration pr치켻endriya does not come within the category of indriyas, not only because its site or controlling point is different from that of other indriyas, but for another reason as well. The ten indriyas function only to perceive tattvas, but pr치켻endriya, being the collective name of the ten v치yus (and v치yu being a bh칰tatattva and a fundamental factor formed due to crudification of ether), comes under the category of tattvas. Indriyas, therefore, are the activators and perceivers of the bh칰tatattvas, and pr치켻endriya is more or less a correlated activity of ten analysed sub-factors of v치yutattva.  \n    Pr치켻endriya plays the most vital part on the physical and psycho-physical level. Every activity of the pr치켻endriya is pulsative  contracting and expanding (sa拷쯞oca-vik치shii). The auxiliary waves of the pr치켻endriya flow in a pulsative manner, that is, there is an arrangement of alternative motions and pauses in their flows. It is during the state of pause and potentiality that the citta is able to receive the tanm치tras and takes the form of shapes represented by those tanm치tras. Unless citta takes the form of incoming tanm치tras no perception is possible, because the ego can work only when the citta adopts a form.  \n    This fact becomes evident by analysing a very common experience. Even if the tanm치tra-discharging objects be present and the afferent nerves working quite all right, there may not be any perception if the citta does not receive the tanm치tras. If one eats something while walking or running, one is not able to enjoy the taste fully. This is due to the citta not being able to receive the tanm치tras under such a circumstance. One is not able to receive and understand a bh치va (idea) simultaneously with some other physical and mental activity. The secret is with the pr치켻endriya.  \n    Pr치켻endriya has got the capacity to let all the nerves flow in the pattern in which it itself is flowing. This means that if pr치켻endriya is in the expansive stage and not in the contracting one, every nerve, along with citta itself, is in the expansive stage flowing in the same wavelength. The result is that incoming tanm치tras face hindrance and cannot activate the citta. Thus either there is difficulty in perception or there is no perception. Therefore, even if all the other factors responsible for perception are working quite satisfactorily, the pr치켻endriya in its expansive stage will cause the citta and nerves to vibrate sympathetically and thereby hamper the movement of the incoming tanm치tras. But if the pr치켻endriya be in the controlling position or at a pause, it creates such a calmness throughout the psycho-physical structure that the correct perception is possible. So actually pr치켻endriya plays a vital part in helping the organs indirectly to receive the tanm치tras, in assisting the citta to perceive them correctly, and thus in letting the ego have a cognition in that connection.  \n    This is the psycho-philosophy behind the practice of pr치켻치y치ma, wherein the s치dhaka tries to let this pr치켻endriya remain in the state of pause, thereby merging the paused unit mind into the ocean of consciousness just to have the experience of the supramental stratum.  \n    In our daily life the experiences of soft and hard, melodious and harsh, hot and cold are being experienced by our pr치켻endriya. These experiences do not come within the scope of the five fundamental perceptions of shrava켻a (hearing), sparshana (feeling by touch), darshana (vision), ashv치dana (taste) and 치ghr치켻a (smell). The aforesaid subtler experiences, not coming within the jurisdiction of crude fundamentality, are felt by the sixth organ  pr치켻endriya. The special function of pr치켻endriya is to recognize the objectives from different experienced sense perceptions and innate psychic projections. Pr치켻endriya also works as an auxiliary force in some of the internal mental activities, and with the help of this pr치켻endriya one feels that a particular person is very kind and affectionate, or a particular person is unkind and antipathetic. (Such an experience is based more on a subjective feeling than on any outer objective correlation.)렢n16.  What is the need to control this prana?  \n    Energy in motion is not continuous but flows in definite little jumps; thus the stream of energy has been called systaltic or pulsatory in the scriptures. This applies equally to all inferential (t치nm치tric) flows, and these currents are received during their phase of contraction in sthirabh칰mi or the citta (mind-stuff; ectoplasm) with the help of the pr치켻a. So the more steadiness one can create in the pr치켻a, the firmer and stronger shall be one뗩 power of receptivity.  \n    The receptive power of pr치켻a finds great scope for expression in a calm mind, with a calm body and calm organs; and its retentive power wanes tremendously during physical or mental restlessness. That is why a restless-minded boy cannot memorize his lessons  he cannot retain them in this pr치켻a. A fickle-minded young man can earn his bread by hard labour, but he cannot take any serious responsibility.  \n    It is only due to the interim motionlessness in the course of movement that a unit entity can comprehend anything. If one becomes restless, one cannot feel an object in the proper perspective. But there may be at least indistinct knowledge of the object due to a relatively slight calmness that still remains in the restlessness. A person in this state is generally called 락ewildered, in a state of doubtful comprehension. The shorter the period of this interim motionlessness, the greater the speed of motivity and thus also the degree of bewilderment. So you see, all forces, whether receptive or rejective, must be pulsative. When they are not pulsative, then their entities are outside the range of comprehension, and are therefore sensorily untenable and intellectually either untenable or quiescent.  \n    The pause period of the systaltic movement is the opportune moment for the acceptance of any sensation or idea. Similarly, the greater the composure in the pr치켻a, the stronger and keener is the power of receptivity. That is why s치dhakas take pains to keep their pr치켻a under restraint and control. In the path of s치dhan치(intuitional practice) there are two ways to control the pr치켻a: pr치켻치y치ma (breath-control) and dh치ra켻치 (concentration).  \n    I have already said that the movement of every mundane force, whether active or reactive, must be pulsative. The period of contraction or cessation is the concluding state of the vital function. When this state of cessation is established permanently in the unit body, the vital functions totally cease. This is the state of death. In such a condition the mind and the other organs are inactive, and so in this long-lasting cessation nothing can be accepted or retained. The practice of pr치켻치y치ma is the practice of control of the pr치켻a  of the expansion of the period of pause for the maximisation of the power of concentration and receptivity. The vital expansion of the pr치켻치y치ma-s치dhaka is also pulsative, the only difference being that the pause is comparatively long. Even in the s치dhan치 of the introspective concentration (dh치ra켻치) when the sthirabh칰mi of the citta is fixed on the object, the vital function is also obliged to gradually prolong the duration of the pause. In that condition the manifestive waves also diminish. Thus whenever people ponder something with rapt attention, the movement of their vital functions gradually becomes more and more tranquil due to the prolongation of the duration of the form waves of their object of imagination.렢n17.  What is the relationship between Pranayama and blood pressure?  \n    There are two emphases in Pranayama first the pause period (kumbhaka) where one reaches full inhalation which is known as Purna Kumbhaka. Concentrating on holding the pause period at this stage puts pressure on the heart and thus is good for those with low blood pressure as the heart has additional stimulus to function. For those with high blood pressure this can be dangerous. If those with high blood pressure concentration concentrate on the pause period of full exhalation (Shunya Kumbhaka) then it will be best because then there is least pressure on the heart.\n18.  What is the process to change the flow of air in the nostrils?  \n    To sleep on the right side with the right hand under the body up to the elbow. This will make the left nostril active. Same for the other side.\n19.  How does pranayama help control the mind?  \n    The Manomaya Ko콑a [subconscious or crude mental mind] is perfected through Pr치n치y치ma.  \n    There is an inseparable relationship between the v치yus of the body [ten basic energy flows] and the mind. Unsteadiness of respiration means unsteadiness of mind and vice versa. Pr치켻치y치ma is the scientific process to control respiration and hence the mind, as a result of which s치dhan치 is especially facilitated.  \n    The flow of breath continues according to the shortening or lengthening of the period of one뗩 thought. By channelizing the natural system of respiration into a particular rhythm one controls one뗩 mind through pr치켻치y치ma.  \n    The indriyas are the controller of the body, the mind the controller of the indriyas, and the vital energy the controller of the mind. That뗩 why on the path of spiritual practice, and particularly in the practice of Ast치u攷귾a yoga (the eight fold path consisting of Yama [don뗪s], Niyama [do뗩], 치sana [yoga exercises], pr치켻치y치ma, praty치h치ra [withdrawal of the mind from externality], dh치ra켻치 [concentration], dhy치na [ideation and absorption in one뗩 Desideratum], and sam치dhi[trance of absorption in Supreme Consciousness]) pr치켻치y치ma plays a very significant role.  \n    So when the respiratory system becomes restless, due to one뗩 individual reactive momenta, the mind also becomes restless. When the mind becomes restless a particular propensity or sense organ also becomes very restless, and another particular propensity or indriya also remains inactive. This is the general rule. But, if one뗩 respiratory system becomes rhythmic and calm through the process of pr치켻치y치ma then a particular propensity or sense organ becomes tranquil. This is something which is very important to remember. Through prolonged practice of pr치켻치yama one learns which propensity or indriya becomes more active due to the restlessness of the respiratory system and which propensity or sense organ becomes more tranquil due to the pause of the respiratory system. This regular practice is known as yoga.  \n    ㄹs the scriptures say, Indriy치켻치拷 mano n치thah manon치th치stu m치rutah  The mind is the master of the sense organs, and air is the master of the mind. The master, the controller and presiding lord of all the organs is the mind; and the one who controls this mind is the s치dhaka, the intelligent one. The s치dhaka controls the mind by controlling maruta [air], which means by controlling the v치yus [ten vital-energy currents in the human body], which means by pr치켻치y치ma [controlling vital energy by controlling the breath]. The expressions of the indriyas are pr치켻a. Pr치켻a is energy; and vital energy is called pr치켻치h. You must have read about this in my book Idea and Ideology. When one wants to have control over pr치켻a  the expression of the indriyas  one has to control the v치yus first. 츼  yam + ghai攷 = 치y치ma, 랎hat which is being controlled. And that by which such control over pr치켻a  the expression of the indriyas  is being effected is pr치켻치y치ma. Hence, pr치켻a + 치y치ma = pr치켻치y치ma. Pr치켻치n yamayatye콑a pr치켻치y치mah  That which gives control over the expressions of the indriyas is pr치켻치y치ma. It is not that the indriyas alone are controlled by pr치켻치y치ma; the master of the indriyas  the mind  also comes under control through pr치켻치y치ma. Thus the mind, although the master of the indriyas, is obviously reduced to the same status as the indriyas. That is why the mind is said to be the eleventh indriya.  \n    This human body is controlled by nerve fibres, which in turn are controlled by nerve cells. The human body generally moves as it is directed to by the mind. But when the body functions under the impact of certain inborn instincts, it does not require direction by the mind. Such actions are absolutely physical or mundane. Then there are some functions which, though physical, are also related to the mind, such as hunger, thirst, sleep and drowsiness. The latter functions are regulated by the ten v치yus [vital-energy flows]  pr치켻a, ap치켻a, sam치na, ud치na, vy치na (the five [internal] v치yus), and n치ga, k칰rma, krkara, devadatta and dhanai攷긁aya (the five [external] v치yus). Through these external v치yus all kinds of natural functions are performed. The mind does not play any particular role in these cases.  \n    All other functions, however, are controlled by the mind. The mind will send instructions to the body according to how it (the mind) is controlled or regulated by physico-psycho-spiritual practices; and in order to control the mind the ten v치yus have to be brought under control. The systematic and scientific process to regulate the v치yus in order to control the mind is called pr치켻치y치ma.  \n    Through the practice of 치sanas and pr치켻ay치ma, one should increase the degree of control of the mind over pr치켻a. During the first stage of s치dhan치 the human mind and body become increasingly pure. This is known as anubhava.렢n20.  How does pranayam increase mental concentration?  \n    It affects the internal and external vayus associated with the cakras. By creating a balanced flow in these vayus and by infusing them with new prana infused with spiritual energy, the cakras and glands become balanced and thus the expression of propensities becomes balanced and do not disturb the mind, enabling greater concentration.  \n    By pranayama the pause period (kumbhaka) between inhalation and exhalation and vice versa is increased. We see that when we are breathing heavily without any pause we cannot think properly. By increasing the pause period the mind develops more and more capacity to assimilate. Generally humans assimilate 1% of what they experience. Increasing the pause period makes it easier for the mind not just to concentrate but also to work systematically, rapidly and efficiently. This gives one greater capacity to judge issues and helps in personality and moral development as well as in social service. The spiritual ideation done with pranayama enables one to have greater capacity to subjectivize what one learned. This enables greater memory retention but also true education as one is able to make what one learns as a part of one뗩 very being.\n21.  How does Pranayama affect one뗩 will power or iccha shakti?  \n    It is because of Pranayama, one뗩 power of judgement, is increased and hence when tempted to selfish or anti-social action, one뗩 increased power of judgement will prod one to refrain from that action. If due to weakness of iccha shakti he is unable to control himself and does what he knows is wrong, immediately afterwards that defeated iccha shakti will recoil and create a feeling of repentance in him. This is how Pranayama helps one in moral life.\n22.  How can Pranayama help one to attain ideological understanding or goals  \n    While practicing Pranayama the vayus become concentrated at a particular place during kumbhaka and mental stamina also gets concentrated there. While exhaling the ectoplasmic potentiality is released. At that time one will gain extra energy to help in attaining one뗩 goal externally. Similarly when done at the time of inhalation, one뗩 ideological understanding is developed. This must be combined with mantra and devotional surrender to prevent from downfall. Gradually one develops more and more capacity to merge one뗩 mind in the Supreme Subjectivity or Supreme Self. Then through one뗩 body divine power and flow to crush exploitation and establish the society of spiritual revolutionaries (sadvipras).\n23.  What is the relationship between prana and the cakras?  \n    The human body is made of five fundamental factors [solid, liquid, luminous, aerial, ethereal], which are controlled by Pr치켻a (vital energy). Pr치켻a is controlled by the mind. So, Pr치켻a and the mind are respectively the direct and the indirect controllers of those fundamental factors. The different seats of the mind for controlling the fundamental factors indirectly are called plexi (cakras). In these cakras the pr치켻a is active. The nucleus that exists in the centre of these cakras bears the controllership of the mind.  \n    The main controlling station of the citta and mind is located in the sixth plexus  the pituitary plexus (치ji攷치 cakra). This plexus also indirectly controls the other fundamental factors. The right petal (the acoustic root of which is Ha) controls the apar치vrtti (propensity of extroversiality) of the human mind. In this it is assisted by the right subtle nerve current (the piu攷귾al치), which primarily controls the left portion of the body and secondarily the right portion.  \n    The left petal of pituitary plexus (whose acoustic root is k콑a) controls the force of spiritual inclination or par치vrtti. With the help of the left subtle nerve or id패치, it primarily controls the activities of the right portion of the body and, secondarily, the activities of the left portion.  \n    But whether the Pr치켻a directly controls the cakras, there too the mind has to remain with it. A part of the mind remains intimately and pervasively associated with Pr치켻a that controls the m칰l치dh치ra cakra. Thus the five ko콑as or layers of the mind  k치mamaya [conscious mind], manomaya [subconscious mind], atim치nasa [supramental mind], viji攷치namaya [subliminal mind] and hira켻maya [subtle causal mind]  chiefly control the five subtle energy centres or cakras  the m칰l치dh치ra [base of the spine; controls the solid factor], sv치dhi콑t패h치na [behind the genital organ; controls the liquid factor], ma켻ipura [navel; controls the luminous factor], an치hata [centre of the chest; controls the aerial factor] and vishuddha cakra [throat; controls the ethereal factor] respectively. 츼ji攷치 cakra [between the eyebrows] does not directly control any fundamental factor, but by its spiritual power controls the psychic force. Those who are engaged in bringing this seat of knowledge under control are the true s치dhakas. For them alone the Divine Sphere remains open.  \n    [If the mind is restless, the body will also be restless, and if the body is restless, the mind will also be restless.] That is why during spiritual practice, the body should be kept motionless. One must practise seated in a certain posture, because if the body becomes calm and motionless the mind also tends to become calm and concentrated. If someone is constantly thinking that he or she will have to sit down at a certain time, stand up at a certain time, catch hold of one뗩 nose or ears at a certain time, the mind will automatically tend to become restless. Such is the intimate relation between the body and the mind. Indriy치켻치m manon치thah manon치thastu m치rutah  The indriyas(2)  both sensory indriyas and motor indriyas  are controlled by [the mind and the mind is controlled by] the v치yus.  \n    This sort of functioning of the mind is discharged in and through the body with the help of the nerve cells and nerve fibres. Its principle controlling centre is situated in the sahasr치ra cakra  the pineal gland  but its substations are located in various parts of the body. The substations are located in sites of the body from which particular kinds of thought-waves control the adjacent areas of the body in their own respective ways. These substations are called cakra or padma or kamala  plexus in Latin  thus we have the various cakras  m칰l치dh치ra, sv치dhi콑t패h치na, ma켻ipura, an치hata, vishuddha, 치ji攷치, etc. The mind, instead of exerting its control directly from the sahasr치ra cakra [above the crown of the head], exerts its control through the other cakras, the other plexi. Hence in order to advance spiritually, one has first to establish control over these lower cakras, then finally over the sahasr치ra cakra.  \n    The matsya s치dhan치 of a Tantric yogi can be interpreted in this way: One who eats the two fish that swim, one through the Ganges (representing the id패치 n치d패ii) and the other through the Yamuna (the piu攷귾al치 n치d패ii)  that is, one who takes the breath flows of the left nostril and the right nostril to the trikut패i [concentration point of the 치ji攷치 cakra] and suspends them there by pur켻a kumbhaka [holding the inhalation] or shunya kumbhaka [holding the exhalation]  is a matsya s치dhaka.  \n    By pranayama, the five internal vayus are affected and all the glands, sub-glands, plexii within their sphere of influence. These glands and sub-glands control different propensities and this affects the mind significantly. This is also why it is so important to maintain spiritual ideation while doing pranayama so that negative propensities are not awakened and so that positive propensities are sublimated into higher forms of expression.  \n    Also Vyana vayu flows throughout the body and when pranayama takes place the vibration of the blood, lymph etc becomes vibrated with the vibration of the spiritual ideation and the sound rhythm of the mantra taken while doing pranayama.\n24.  How is pranayama related to the higher meditational practice of dhyana?  \n    The practice of dhy치na [meditation in which the psyche merges in the Consciousness of the Ideational Desideratum or I콑t패a] becomes a time-consuming affair if pr치켻치y치ma is not adequately practised.  \n    It is the process by which the movement of vital energy is controlled by a spiritual aspirant. But pr치켻치y치ma should always be associated with bindu dhy치na [ideation on a point], that is, meditation on a particular point. If pr치켻치y치ma is not associated with bindu dhy치na, it will affect self-restraint. Pr치켻치y치ma will make the mind restless.  \n    Coming close to Him is not enough. You will have to merge your unit I in Him. You will have to transform your idea of I am Brahma into Self-realization through the process of dhy치na. In order to establish oneself in dhy치na, one will have to do 치sanas [yoga exercises], praty치h치ra [mental withdrawal from the physical and psychic realms], pr치켻치y치ma and dh치ra켻치 [concentration].렢n25.  How is pranayama related to the Onmkara (AUM)?  \n    Pra켻avo dhanuh sharohy치m치 brahma tallak콑yamucyate  \n    Apramattena veddhavya拷 sharavat tanmayo bhavet. (Upanishad)  \n    O Sedate One, O攷拷쯞치ra is the image of your bow. Here the twanging or plucking of the bow means the act of Pr치켻치y치ma (a yogic method of breath-control), i.e., stirring up the vital or spiritual force. If you use your soul as an arrow and shoot it aiming at the Brahma-like target with a deeply concentrated (absolutely unwavering) mind, then your soul will certainly merge in the Supreme Soul just as an ordinary arrow sticks in its target.렢n26.  What is the spirit of pr치켻치y치ma?  \n    Pr치n치n yamayati e콑ah pr치켻치y치mah. That is, the word pr치켻치y치ma literally means 띾ontrolling the pr치켻치h [vital energy]. The psycho-philosophy behind the practice of pr치켻치y치ma is that the spiritual aspirant tries to let the pr치켻endriya [ten vital-energy currents] remain in a state of pause so that the paused unit mind will merge into the ocean of consciousness.렢n27.  How many types of pr치켻치y치ma are there?  \n    There are two main types of pr치켻치y치ma: hat패ha yaogika pr치켻치y치ma and Yudhi콑t패hira pr치켻치y치ma. When pr치켻치y치ma is done without fixing the mind on a particular point of concentration, and without imbibing Cosmic ideation, it is called hat패ha yaogika pr치켻치y치ma. But when pr치켻치y치ma is performed with the mind fixed at a particular point along with Cosmic ideation, it is called Yudhi콑t패hira pr치켻치y치ma. [The eldest Pandava, Yudhisthira, was the first person to popularize pr치켻치y치ma according to this method.]렢n28.  What are the different stages of pranayama known as recaka, p칰raka, and kumbhaka?  \n    ㄹt the time of pr치켻치y치ma, when one exhales the breath completely, it is called recaka; when one inhales completely, it is called p칰raka; and when one retains air inside the body, it is called kumbhaka.  \n    The human respiratory system also provides us with a good comparison with the systaltic flow of movement. Puraka [inhalation] can be compared with the movement towards manifestative pause. The retention of breath at the end of puraka (p칰r켻a kumbhaka) is manifestative pause. Recaka [exhalation] is the movement towards systolic pause. And holding the breath after complete exhalation (sh칰nya kumbhaka) is systolic pause. In the retention of breath after inhalation there is manifestation of time and continuity of movement, but no sense of dynamism. In the total exhalation, however, there is no manifestation of time but there is continuity of movement minus the sense of dynamism. [From the end of] one puraka to the beginning of another puraka constitutes half of the cycle of respiration. After every such half-cycle or trip, that is, in every post-exhalation pause, there occurs the death of the unit being. But after gathering vitality for the second time from this death or state of pause, the unit being comes alive again during the next inhalation. If, after the full cycle of inhalation and exhalation, the physical mechanism is unable to gather vital force from the state of pause, further inhalation becomes impossible and what we commonly call death occurs.  \n    Actually, the unit structure dies thousands of times every day, after every exhalation. In the scriptures this sort of microcosmic death is called the kha켻d패a pralaya [partial annihilation] of the unit entity. When the temporal factor is evident and the seed of or potential for further inhalation and exhalation is intact, this cannot be considered death. Yogic texts prescribe various methods of recak치nta pr치켻치y치ma and purak치nta pr치켻치y치ma [respiratory control] whereby a huge quantity of vital force may be acquired from the five fundamental factors.  \n    Recaka means 란mptying. When one exhales completely and keeps the breath out during the process of breathing, it is called recaka.  \n    In the case of respiration also, after human beings inhale, they do not immediately exhale. They retain the breath inside for a while, and then they exhale. Similarly, after exhaling, they do not immediately inhale. They stop for a little while, and then only do they inhale. So in both cases there is a pause for a short while. The first pause, after inhalation, is called p칰r켻a kumbhaka, and the second pause, after exhalation, is called sh칰nya kumbhaka. These are states of pause, not of speed. A state of pause is nothing but a state of death, because in that state of pause every function is suspended, every vibration is suspended. At that time the vibrations of all objects of this universe remain in you in seed form, but not yet fully accepted or assimilated. The vibrations have no doubt reached you in seed form, but the understanding of them, that is, the acceptance of them, will come later.렢n29.  Many yogis spend a lot of time doing pranayama. Is this the true yoga?  \n    Many people criticize this path of hat패ha yoga because, they say, the practices of 치sanas, pr치켻치y치ma, etc. are not very congenial for spiritual progress. In fact, the defects of this system are as follows; first such yogiis cannot render any useful service to the world, for they have to keep themselves engaged in these practices for twenty-four hours a day. But human beings have to do so many things in life, not only the practices of 치sanas, pr치켻치y치ma, etc. They must learn many things and teach many things to others. Instead of doing that, if some people spend a major portion of their days practising pr치켻치y치ma, how will they find time for setting an example for others?  \n    Yes, pr치켻치y치ma has its necessity  a limited necessity; but any rigorous practice should be done for the welfare of others, otherwise what is the benefit of such practices with one뗩 legs up and head down, sitting beside a firepit? Unnecessarily the practitioners subject themselves to physical torture. People understand the utility of austerity when they realize that the world of living beings was created by our Lord, and if we serve His world, how pleased He will be! If I undergo penance while rendering service to the society, there is no selfishness in this because the austerity is no longer a penance  it becomes a source of joy. Hence those who undergo penance for the sake of penance are greatly mistaken.  \n    The same applies to Yoga. If yoga is treated as a means of realizing Parama Puru콑a and not as a type of hat패h치 yoga, then this is the real yoga. Otherwise if one practices pr치켻치y치ma for a long portion of the day, then one뗩 coming onto this earth becomes meaningless. Many people suspend their vital energy by means of hat패h치 yogic practices. Others wrongly think that since such people can suspend their life-force, they must be great personalities  mah치puru콑as. Such a notion is wholly defective. Through regular practice, one뗩 life-force can be suspended, but that does not prove one뗩 greatness. One can survive for long without food; there are some specific techniques for that; but most people in the world do not know those methods, If those who know the methods are called mah치puru콑as, this is not correct.렢n30.  Is hatha yoga a genuine yoga?  \n    Depending upon the difference in the controlling points of the cakras, spiritual s치dhan치 can take either of two forms: (1) Controlling the hormone secretion of the glands and strengthening the controlling points of the cakras is the system known as hatha yoga, because it is more physical in character. This science is more extroversive in character and consequently part of avidya tantra. (2) To surrender one뗩 mind to Shrii Kr콑켻a  This is introversive or ideational in character and is part of Vidy치 Tantra. This is the real s치dhan치, where the entire psycho-physical entity surrenders itself to Parama Puru콑a.  \n    The meeting point between Lord Kr콑켻a and the jiiv치tma is just below the pineal gland or sahasr치ra cakra.렢n31.  What is the relationship between devotion, yoga and one뗩 life breath or prana?  \n    Yoga without devotion is as good as a goldsmith without gold. Unfortunate is the Yogii who is bereft of devotion. You will have to do S치dhan치 of Ji攷치na [realizing Supreme Consciousness in all beings] and Karma [working and serving Supreme Consciousness in all beings]. By doing simply 츼sana and Pr치n치y치ma, the Supreme Entity cannot be attained. The most important thing is devotion.  \n    럭The true meaning of the word yoga is 땂o unify. But those who do 치sanas, pr치켻치y치ma, etc., without devotion are cultivating the desert. Without the water of devotion, their effort will not succeed. I am not in the hearts of such dry yogis.  \n    Bhakti or devotion is service to Parama Puru콑a. It is love and bliss personified, the very breath of devotee.렢n32.  What is then the primary process of pranayama in Ananda Marga?  \n    Closing the eyes, sit in either siddh치sana, padm치sana or bhojan치sana. Do bh칰tashuddhi. After doing 치sana shuddhi, concentrate your mind on the point that the 치c치rya will fix. Then, after doing cittashuddhi, ideate on the first syllable of your I콑t패a mantra, press and close the right nostril with the thumb of the right hand, and draw in a deep breath through the left nostril. During inhalation, ideate that infinite vital energy is entering the point from the infinite Brahma who is existing all around. After taking a full breath close the left nostril with the middle, ring and little fingers, and, taking the thumb away from the right nostril, slowly let out the air (Ideate that the infinite vital energy is returning from the point to that Infinite Brahma). During exhalation ideate on the remaining syllable of your I콑t패a mantra. When the breath has been fully expelled from the right nostril, inhale as fully as possible again through the right nostril. Afterwards, closing the right nostril with the thumb and removing the fingers, exhale the air through the left nostril. This completes one round.  \n    For the first week, complete three rounds each time. The number is increased by one round every week until seven rounds is reached.  \n    Pr치켻치y치ma can be practised up to four times in a day. If a person practising pr치켻치y치ma twice daily wishes to practise three times on any particular day, he/she may do so, but the person who practises twice daily must not suddenly increase to four times, because that will result in the body falling sick. Therefore it is advisable at first to do the practise twice daily, increasing it by one round per week. If, however, on any day two times pr치켻치y치ma is not completed, then at the end of the week, the number of times missed must be practised in compensation before increasing the number of rounds.  \n    Practitioners of pr치켻치y치ma should try to keep themselves away from dust, smoke, bad-smelling environments and excessive labour. It is very helpful to take a sufficient amount of milk products for the first two months following commencement of the practice.  \n    By Sadvipra it is not meant those who practice Mala-Jap or Pr치켻치y치m. In Pr치켻치y치m also there are three stages  Puraka means to inhale; Kumbhaka which is to hold the breath and recak which to exhale. The Pr치켻치y치ma of the Sadvipras will be to inhale the entire universe in Puraka, to keep it within in Kumbhaka and then to exhale it after mixing it with their own greatness and good will in Recaka.\n33.  Why should one learn pranayama directly from a qualified acarya [one who teaches by one뗩 conduct] so that one can properly learn the ideation that needs to be performed while doing pranayama?  \n    Pr치켻치y치ma is meant for s치dhakas [aspirants of Supreme Consciousness]  it is better for non-s치dhakas not to take the risk of injuring themselves by doing pr치켻치y치ma. Pr치켻치y치ma is also very beneficial for the physical body. Special pr치켻치y치ma practices are prescribed for specific diseases. No one should practise pr치켻치y치ma without the permission of an 치c치rya.  \n    There are abuses of pr치켻치y치ma also. If s치dhakas during the period of pr치켻치y치ma-induced contraction, indulge themselves merely in the parading of their own petty vanity instead of using that force of contraction for the inculcation brahmabh치va (cosmic ideation); that is, if they devote themselves to the expression of their own little egos, they will gradually tend towards crudeness. Even without practising pr치켻치y치ma, if people zealously propel their little egos towards worldly enjoyments, they will also meet the same fate. Pr치켻치y치ma is exceedingly harmful  devastatingly disastrous  for those without cosmic ideation or Brahmabh치va. In common experience we find that whenever people absorb themselves in some work, their power of contraction increases, and the movement of their pr치켻a becomes steady and regulated; but whenever they indulge in any sensuous or crude act, the movement of their pr치켻a becomes remarkably unsteady and agitated. In such a condition their minds are not amenable to comprehension, thought or judgement.렢n34.  Finally, what is the state of mind of a genuine practitioner of pranayama?\n\n**츼mi tom치y cini tom치re d치ki  \nTumi 치m치r pr치켻a  \n츼m치r sab h치r치nor vedan치te  \nTumi bhar치 v치n  \nTumi priiti g치n  \nTumi 치m치r pr치켻a.  \n(Prabh치ta Sa拷쯚iita* 686)**  \n_O I know You, recognize You only  \nAh I call You,  \nYou are my prana.  \nFor vanquishing and dispelling  \nSorrows and pain,  \nOnly You are the  \nOverwhelming, fulfilling floodwaters,  \nYou are the song of love.  \nYou are my prana._\n\n* Prabh치ta Sa拷쯚iita refers to the 5018 songs composed by Shrii Shrii Anandamurtiji in just eight years.\n\n#### 5th Lesson\n\nShrii Sarkar has said that the most important aspect of spiritual practice is cakra shodhana and cakra niyantra켻a. Let us explore the importance then of Cakra Shodhana or the 5th Lesson of Ananda Marga Sahaja Yoga.\n\nUnderstanding the Fifth Lesson\n\n\u003e The word shodhana literally means refinement or 랋urification. In spiritual meditation shodhana is concentration on the cakras. It is a part of Ananda Marga s치dhan치 which is not included in a콑t패치拷쯚a yoga [the eight-fold path of yoga].  \n\u003e For spiritual advancement spiritual practices are a must, and in spiritual practices the role of the cakras [plexi] is immense. In fact, the most important aspect of spiritual practice is cakra shodhana and cakra niyantra켻a [the purification and control, respectively, of the cakras].  \n\u003e BABA\n\nIn Third Lesson, the cakras are primarily understood as controllers of the five fundamental factors of the body. These fundamental factors are ultimately what the body is created from, hence controlling the cakras and thereby the bhutas is the key to liberating the mind from material consciousness and moving towards samadhi and liberation. It is also the key to establishing oneself in 1st lesson which also involves purification of the bhutas (bhuta shuddhi).  \nIn Fifth Lesson the cakras are dealt with in a more subtle way. Cakras are controlling nodes of the vast network of nadiis. Nadiis are channels of vital and psychic energies. Just like there is a vast network of physical nerves throughout our body, similarly on the level of divine energy there are said to be around 72,000 nadiis in the subtler body. These nadis are connected with the various vayus (vital forces or airs) which are controlled by Pranayama. Just as purifying the cleansing the heart and other organs purifies the blood, so also purifying the cakras purifies the flow of the 10 vayus in the nadiis. This is crucial for Fourth lesson of Pranayama involving the assimilation of vital energy into the vayus and their control and sublimation.\n\nPranayama controls and purifies the mind and if done with ideation awakens devotion. This devotion increases when the cakras and the network of nadiis is purified. Furthermore when the nadiis are purified the vayus themselves become more quickly purified. This gives rise of various spiritual and devotional experiences in the form of different bhavas.\n\nThe cakras we know are themselves a cluster of various glands and their associated psychic propensities and hormones. So purification of the cakras restores prama or balance between these glands and between the cakras. This prepares the way forward for revolutionary spiritual and devotional changes in the body. While all cakras are purified Baba gave especial importance to purifying the Ajina Cakra [centre of the eyebrows] as it controls all the higher cakras and enables the person to assimilate the nectar secreted by the Sahasrara Cakra [crown of the head]. All the flows of propensities, desires, sentiments associated with the lower cakras are to be focused and directed towards merging in the flow from the Para Vrtti or pure spiritual propensity of the Ajina Cakra. This enables the aspirant to become established in the Sahasrara Cakra more and more. This happens naturally when Fifth Lesson is done in a Baba-centred manner.\n\nThe Third Lesson involves controlling each cakra and surrendering it to the Paramestin Guru. The Fifth Lesson involves purifying, sublimating and dissolving each cakra into the flow of Baba뗩 radiance and love.\n\nThe Fifth Lesson purifies the major cakras but if each cakra is properly purified one will feel the entire network of nadiis connected with that cakra being purified. One will feel the minor cakras (upacakras) being awakened and purified. We should also note that the kosas are associated with the cakras and hence by this lesson the kosas are purified and merged more and more into a flow of loving surrender. This feeling of lightness and purity will also be felt on the physical level as well. This is because the vayus purify the sub-minds of the various small (protozoic) and large (metazoic) cells of the body. Many physical ailments can be cured by this lesson for those who give importance to their bodies.\n\nHowever these are mainly important for the addiction of lower yogis to psycho-spiritual pleasures. For the devotees one will have more intense experience of Baba뗩 Darshan, especially through experiences of Baba뗩 scent. Baba뗩 wondrous fragrances is celebrated in Prabhat Samgiit in many songs. This is why singing Prabhat Samgiit before doing sadhana (including 5th lesson). For those who have great yearning (viraha) fifth lesson will cause one to have the vision (Darshan) of Baba in different cakras and all over the body and the universe. Such devotees will be lost in wonder marveling at the rapturous beauty with which Baba is adorned with wondrous coloured clothes and different coloured radiances. In countless Prabhat Samgiit the wonderful ways in which Baba is adorned is celebrated. Fifth lesson prepares us thus for dhyana\n\nBut this is not all. The subtle sense of supra-aesthetics (science of how Baba makes us fall in love with Him) creates new refined behaviour and forms of society (samaja). This is how a devotional civilization will created. Manifestation [of culture] is coupled with purification of feelings  civility and decorousness of expression. What after all, is civilization? The subtle sense of refinement that we come across in the different expressions of life is called civilization. The subtle sense of refinement is the touchstone of civilization. The subtle sense of refinement that we get in culture intrinsically imbibes the human power of discriminative judgement. This discriminative judgement is the essence of justice.\n\nBringing justice to everyone and everything due to the blazing tenderness of one뗩 devotional heart is the essence of Neohumanism. Through Neohumanism a brand new spiritual and cultural civilization and psychology is created which serves as the foundation for PROUT뗩 socio-economic movements of samajas (eco-cultural regions). Fifth Lesson is done collectively in the form of Baba Pari Mandala Goshti practices of using kiirtana to charge particular valleys, rivers, hills and mountains with spiritual and devotional energies so as to create a new spiritual geography. This is just a glimpse of the infinite exquisite forms of bh치va (ecstasy) in the vast realm of Fifth Lesson.\n\n#### Kapalik치\n\nOne special spiritual practice to further accelerate the creation of viiras is Kapalika sadhana. This is a special spiritual practice perform at midnight and therafter in cremation grounds, cemeteries or jungles and is perfomed with a skull and knives. In such an environment all the crude propensities such as panicking fears, material or psychic desires rise up with tremendous force. Through this spiritual practice this tremendous force is sublimated thus giving tremendous power to the yogi. Those who are devotees utilize this force to full surrender and hence become the vehicle of Dharma Shakti [Cosmic energy of divine righteous fight against injustice and inequality]. However, others may misuse this energy to develop occult powers so as to control and influence people.  \nThe Tantrics of bygone days used to do shava sadhana [Tantric meditation sitting on a dead body] in the darkness of the new moon night. As Shrii Sarkar reveals,\n\n\u003e I think you all know that Sad치shiva was the first Tantric Mah치kaola on this planet. His mission was Kurvantu vishva拷 T치ntrikam  To get the whole universe initiated into the Tantric cult. To become a Tantric means to fight directly against the opposing forces and obstacles on the path of progress and to preach the lofty gospels of universal humanism. That human beings are the greatest of all living beings is to be proven in action, not in mere words or theoretical moral principles  \n\u003e Later Shiva felt that there should be proper media to propagate the grand and lofty ideals He was teaching. Tom치r pat치k치 y치re d치o t치re bahib치re d치o shakti [Give strength to the person to whom you give the flag to carry렣. Otherwise who would be able to carry forth so much knowledge, wisdom, intellect, and such a deep spiritual cult? Incompetent people cannot be expected to carry the legacy of anything. If I teach something to an incompetent or undesirable person, it will bear no fruit, it will get wasted. A heron can never learn to speak like a mynah bird, no matter how much it is trained. The incompetent person is just like the heron. What did Shiva do about this?  \n\u003e P치rvatii had a son called Bhaerava, and K치lii a daughter named Bhaeravii. Shiva first taught Bhaerava Tantra s치dhan치, or k치p치lika s치dhan치 (the Tantric s치dhan치 which utilizes the human skull); and the t치켻d패ava dance. Since then all those people who have learned the Tantric practices have also been called Bhaerava, they all introduce themselves by the name Bhaerava. They lose their individual names such as R치ma, Shy치ma, Tom or Dick, and automatically become a part of Shivagotra [the Family of Shiva].  \n\u003e Shiva proclaimed, You are all mine. Whatever hill you live on you are still my own. I will think well of you. I will think about your collective welfare. I will work for your collective well-being. Come one and all to me safely and fearlessly and tell me your needs. I will help you. 츼tmagotra拷 parityajya Shivagotra拷 pravishatu [Leave your own gotra and enter Shivagotra뗗.  \n\u003e Whoever is a spiritualist has left his or her own gotra and has entered the Shivagotra. In Ananda Marga also, separate gotras are not recognized. All belong to Shivagotra. I have only stated that at the time of marriage the bride and bridegroom should not have any direct relationship three generations above and three generations below. If this condition is not met, the marriage should not be solemnized.  \n\u003e Ananda Margis have no caste or gotra. I have said before also that the division of humanity into K치shyapagotra, Bharadv치jagotra, etc., is nonsensical. This is just to mislead people. If we look back in [anthropology] we will see that the forefathers of the present-day humans were apes or ape-men. So if people are very particular about their gotras, I will say to their faces, Boys and girls! You belong to the ape gotra.  \n\u003e We have all descended from our common ancestors, the apes. The same is true in relation to the castes. [One might try to argue that] the forefathers of the Br치hma켻as were the ape-Br치hma켻as and the forefathers of the K콑atriyas were the ape-K콑atriyas; but that just isn뗪 so. As apes do not have any particular caste, the present-day caste differences are all hypocrisy and maliciousness. You should remove even the least vestige of these nonsensical notions. You must not give credence to such things.  \n\u003e So Shiva taught Bhaerava. Then He thought: If I teach this only to my son; that is, if my son alone knows this secret spiritual cult, this great asset for humanity, and my daughter remains ignorant, then fifty per cent of the society will remain a burden for the other fifty per cent; that is, the women will remain a burden for the men, and the movement of the men also will be greatly impeded. Even in those days, seven thousand years ago, Shiva thought in this way. If I only give the strength and responsibility to carry the burden to my son, Bhaerava, that will not be good. I will also have to give some of the responsibility to my daughter, Bhaeravii. And that is what He did. And since that day, any woman practising Tantra is known as Bhaeravii.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Bhaerava and Bhaeravii, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 7\n\nShrii Sarkar reveals who is a Bhaerava saying\n\n\u003e The Entity who keeps on beating the drum of time, and at whose instance the message of time is sounded, echoed and vibrated in entities everywhere  that fearful entity or Bhaerava (bhae + rava = bhaerava, 딾ne whom people fear)  is called K치labhaerava. K치labhaerava is another name of Lord Shiva. Those persons who, inspired by this Cosmic acoustic centre of Shiva, create ever-new epicentres in their psychic sphere and transmit the various acoustic effects throughout the world, are called bhaeravas. And their primal source, that is, Shiva, is called K치labhaeerava.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Discourse 23, Shabda Cayanik치 Part 4\n\nThus Bhaeravas function as broadcasters and nuclei of divine energies. It is through these divine energies that society can be dramatically transformed. Shrii Sarkar said that European communism fell due to the sudden expansion of consciousness was created due to PROUT, Neohumanism and spiritual philosophy. This sudden expansion occurs when divine energy is transmitted in a particular area through a Bhaerava. Shrii Sarkar explains how the viira practices this sadhana saying,\n\n\u003e Tantra advises, Jump into your environment without the least hesitation. Don뗪 be afraid. Fear will leave you step by step. Tomorrow you will not be as fearful as you are today, the day after you will be even less fearful, and ten days from now you뗣l notice that you are completely fearless. The process of Tantra s치dhan치 is formulated along these lines. The very first night that a Tantric goes to the burial ground he is stricken with fear; there is horripilation all over the body. But when he returns home after finishing s치dhan치, the mind is much lighter than before. When he goes out for s치dhan치 the next night, he is much less fearful. And thus the Tantric steadily and slowly overcomes fear. This is the applied process of Tantra which will help the practitioner overcome all mental propensities. In Tantra, there is a nice blending between the internal s치dhan치, an ongoing psychic process, and physico-psychic s치dhan치.\n\u003e \n\u003e  The Fundamental Difference between Veda and Tantra, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 5\n\nThose who are established in this sadhana are called Kapalikas. Shrii Sarkar explains their mission as follows,\n\n\u003e In Buddhist philosophy K치rya Brahma is called Sa拷쯨rtti bodhicitta. Ka拷 sa拷쯨rtti bodhicittam p치layati iti k치p치lika  He who protects the created universe, he who is engaged in the p치lana kriy치 of the expressed universe, is k치p치lika.\n\u003e \n\u003e  His Reflections Are Everywhere, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 3\n\n\u003e The first letter created in the Macrocosmic body during the formation of vyai攷긁anas is ka; this ka is the acoustic root. This universe has thus been created with acoustic root ka. To serve the ka-deva means to serve the entire manifestation of the Cosmos. That is why they who serve and look after that which has manifested in the Cosmos are known as k치p치lika.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Macro-Propensitive Equipoise and Non-Propensitive Desideratum, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 31\n\n#### Vae콑켻ava\n\nNow the heroism of the Tantric does not simply create courage and fighting spirit. It also creates deep devotional bliss of the Vae콑켻ava  the second form of Ananda Marga sadhana. As Shrii Sarkar explains,\n\n\u003e In the second stage Prakrti is willing to take the shelter of Puru콑a, but the s치dhaka is indifferent, and remains absorbed in the flow of Cosmic bliss  so this is Vae콑켻ava s치dhan치   \n\u003e In the Vae콑켻ava stage s치dhakas [spiritual aspirants] remain totally unconcerned as to who is Puru콑a and who is Prakrti. Their only desire is to become one with Brahma in the flow of bliss. They do not make a hair-splitting analysis regarding fight or non-fight, for they know they will remain absorbed in the Cosmic flow of bliss for eternity. This is the true spirit of Vae콑켻ava s치dhan치. Vi콑켻u means 라ll-pervading, 란xpansive  so the proper etymological meaning of Vae콑켻ava is 랏niversalist.  \n\u003e Vaishnavite bh치va [spiritual stance] can be divided into two stages: liil치bh치va and nityabh치va. When a s치dhaka뗩 mind oscillates [among different experiences] along the paths of the sai攷귺ara and pratisai攷귺ara of Brahma and becomes inextricably merged with Its panoramic expressions, that condition is called liil치bh치va, and the s치dhaka뗩 blissful feeling is called liil치nanda. In liil치bh치va the s치dhakas entire existences become vibrated with the vibrations of the Cosmic dance, causing them to burst out in dance, laughter, tears and song. But in nity치nanda there is no such expression as this. Puru콑ottama [the Nucleus Consciousness] is the supreme source of the countless forms and flows that emanate during liil치bh치va; but His own stance is nityabh치va [eternal and unchangeable]. So the 치nanda which s치dhakas experience when united with Him in His unchangeable, eternal stance is called nity치nanda  \n\u003e The mundane obstacles, the friends and foes, merge in the Vaishnavite s치dhakas world of blissful ideation. With whom will they fight? They feel that the entire universe is an unbroken divine play composed of R치dh치 and Kr콑켻a. In this stage there is a clear dominance of action and devotion. Vaishnavite s치dhan치 is a blissful flow indeed. Such s치dhakas are like points on the circumference of the Cosmic Circle, moving towards the Nucleus, Puru콑ottama, along the radius, which is their s치dhan치. And the expanse through which they move towards Him along the radius is the r칰pas치gar [ocean of beauteous forms], the ras치mrtasindhu [ocean of bliss]. Such s치dhakas reap only, through reactive actions, the consequences of their past actions. Ji攷치na is not dominant in this Vaishnavite stage. Vaishnavite s치dhakas say that Puru콑ottama is enacting His liil치 [divine game] through this expressed universe. They say, O Lord, You are both wisdom and ignorance, happiness and sorrow. Some people You place on golden thrones as kings, others You throw into the street to beg from door to door with outstretched begging bowls. You are my joy, You are my sorrow. Do whatever You like with me. Such s치dhakas would never say, O Lord, save me from danger, but  \n\u003e _Sudh치raseo bh치s치o yakhan  \n\u003e Dhanya Hari dhanya Hari;  \n\u003e Vyath치 diye k치nd치o yakhan  \n\u003e Dhanya Hari dhanya Hari._  \n\u003e _When You float me on the waves of bliss, O Lord, You are really gracious, and when You make me cry in pain, You are equally gracious. In happiness I feel Your sweet touch, and burst into laughter, exhilarated by Your divine sport. In sorrow I also feel Your sweet touch, and burst into tears, overwhelmed by Your divine sport. How strange You are! How wonderful! I have nothing to complain about._  \n\u003e In the final stage of Vaishnavite s치dhan치, the unit mind becomes one with the Cosmic Mind. The moment before the final merger, s치dhakas realize that the Entity who has come in the form of happiness is their dearest Lord, and the Entity who has come in the form of sorrow is also their dearest Lord. They feel the divine joy of the Cosmic play. They never retreat, for having passed through the Sh치kta stage they have acquired immense courage and valour. One who has not been an ideal Sh치kta cannot be an ideal Vae콑켻ava. In the final stage of the Vae콑켻ava cult, s치dhakas offer their greatest treasure  their mind  to Brahma, and in exchange for this supreme gift expect nothing in return. In the absence of mind they cannot enjoy the sweetness of the divine play any longer. At that supreme stage of surrender liil치nanda is transformed into nity치nanda.\n\u003e \n\u003e  S치dhan치, Discourses on Tantra Volume Two\n\n#### Acquiring Knowledge\n\nNow this state of being a viira or hero not only results in devotion but also causes the evolution a more intuitive level of knowledge.\n\n\u003e In the upa-치tmasthiikara켻치 stage one enters the psychic stratum. Take the case of the palmyra tree. What group does it belong to? It belongs to the palm group. What are the physical characteristics of the trees of the palm group? What are their psychic wants? By posing such questions you will gain knowledge about the palmyra and its special psychology. You will realize that if the saliva of any animal touches the palmyra tree, its growth gets stunted.  \n\u003e Suppose an animal eats the leaves of a palmyra sapling and drops a little of its saliva onto the plant. The speed of its growth will certainly be hampered. So according to its peculiar psychology, it reacts when the external saliva comes in contact with its internal psychic juice. Consequently its natural growth and fruit bearing capacity will be decreased. This is the general rule of all the trees of the palm group. Coconuts and betel-nut trees have the same characteristics.  \n\u003e You will understand these facts through upa-치tmasthikara켻am because you become acquainted with it뗩 basic psychology. When you sit beside a tree you will intuitively understand what the tree is thinking. Of course, the tree won뗪 say anything loudly, but you will be able to communicate with it because your mind has established a link with its mind. Regarding the characteristics of trees in the palm group, [the folk poet] K콑a켻치 said,  \n\u003e B치ra batsare phele t치l,  \n\u003e Yadi n치 l치ge gorur n치l.  \n\u003e [The (palm) tree bears fruit at twelve years of age provided it is not touched by the saliva of cows.]  \n\u003e [The palm tree cannot tolerate cow saliva.] So in the stage of upa-치tmasthikara켻a one comes in contact with the inner heart, the inner life and the inner mind of all objects, leading to one뗩 knowledge becoming deeper and more confirmed. The mind derives much contentment from its contact with the inner mind of certain plants, animals and human beings, for through such contact one can render better to service to them. One will develop a certain degree of self satisfaction for one뗩 psychic assimilation will have been of some use. This is also a step in the acquisition of knowledge.  \n\u003e But it does have a particular disadvantage. This contact with the inner mind of a tree, animal or human being depends on the freshness or strength of your mind. If for some reason your mental power is lost, then the capacity to acquire knowledge through superficial psychic assimilation and upa-치tmasthikara켻a will also be lost. Suppose you are a very experienced psychologist. If your mind ceases to function properly, you won뗪 be able to utilize any of that knowledge you had acquired. People who have practised the s치dhan치 of avidy치 tantra can develop the power to know the minds of others. But such acquired power is short-lived  it will desert them one day. If they misuse even a small amount of this acquired power, they will lose it immediately.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Ekendriya  2, Ananda Marga Philosophy in a Nutshell Part 6\n\n#### Gopii Bh치va\n\nAs we have seen the raising of the kundalinii and the resulting form of devotion is described in terms of the historic devotees of Lord Krsna during His childhood.\n\nㄹnd when it [kundalinii] moves from the navel cakra to the trikut패i, or 치ji攷치 cakra, that is known as gopii bh치va. (Kr콑켻a Unparalleled, Discourses on Kr콑켻a and the Giita)\n\n#### S치yujya Devotional Sam치dhi\n\nThe next form of devotional intoxication and love that results as the kundalinii rises is known as S치yujya Sam치dhi. This is explained as follows:\n\n\u003e Then when that sleeping divinity, that kulaku켻d패alinii, crosses the an치hata cakra, this plexus, this 랍olar plexus (in Latin), the s치dhaka뗩 feelings are known as s치yujya. S치yujya means 랄n close contact. In Sanskrit s치yujya means 띾lose contact, just side by side, just touching. In s치lokya He is with you. In s치miipya you feel the proximity, the nearness. And here in s치yujya what do you feel? A tactual experience. You get a tactual experience.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Stages of Sam치dhi, Discourses on Tantra  1\n\n\u003e Again, as a result of further s치dhan치, what happens? One feels that one is in close touch with Him. In pleasure, in predicament, one always feels that one is in close touch with Him. You see, when you are being punished by Him, do you not feel His existence? Do you not feel His touch? You feel His touch. So this is called s치yujya sam치dhi. In both pleasure and predicament you feel you are in touch with Him.\n\u003e \n\u003e  The Grandeur of the Supreme Entity, Subh치콑ita Sa拷쯚raha Part 24\n\n#### S치r칰pya Devotional Sam치dhi\n\nAs the kundalinii rise even higher the Sam치dhi that ensues is called S치r칰pya. Shrii Sarkar explains this as follows:\n\n\u003e And the next stage of this r치g치nug치 sam치dhi (here r치g치nug치 sam치dhi, r치g치nug치 bhakti, means, O God, O N치r치ya켻a, I don뗪 want anything from You; I love You because by loving You I get pleasure) is s치r칰pya. In s치r칰pya one feels, There is hardly any difference between myself and my Lord. The poet Vidyapati of Mithila said: M치dhava M치dhava anukhana sumari Sundarii M치dhava bhelii [R치dh치 while constantly remembering M치dhava became M치dhava Himself렣. Here, Sundarii means R치dh치. She always ideates on M치dhava. What is the meaning of M치dhava? M치 means 랎he Operative Principle, and dhava means 랃usband, controller. The Operative Principle is Param치 Prakrti, and Her dhava, husband, is Parama Puru콑a. So M치dhava means the husband of Prakrti, that is, Parama Puru콑a. So R치dh치 always ideates on M치dhava, and what is the result? Finally R치dh치 feels that she has become M치dhava. This is what is called s치r칰pya sam치dhi. And this is the last stage of r치g치nug치 bhakti. (Ibid.)\n\n#### R치g치tmik치 Bhakti\n\nS치r칰pya was the last stage of R치g치nug치 Bhakti. After this a new more self-effacing form of bhakti emerges as Shrii Sarkar explains,\n\n\u003e By taking the ideation of Parama Puru콑a, when the quantity of pleasure increases, a person loses the self first. What happens when he or she is lost? He or she feels I take the ideation of Parama Puru콑a not for my sake, not for me. I love Parama Puru콑a so that he may get pleasure because of my love, I wish to give Him pleasure. I may or may not get it. When this stage is attained, this is called R치g치tmik치 Bhakti. In this stage one feels, I love Parama Puru콑a, I do not care whether He loves me or lot, He likes me or not, but I like Him. I This is R치g치tmik치 Bhakti. When this R치g치tmik치 Bhakti is attained, in that stage one is also called Gopa as described in scriptures (sh치stras):  \n\u003e _Gop치yate yah sah gopah._  \n\u003e Gopa here does not mean the cowherd or the caretaker of cows. Gop치yate means to give pleasure  Gop치yate yah sah gopah. One whose nature is to give pleasure to Parama Puru콑a or Param치tm치 is Gopa. When R치g치tmik치 Bhakti is attained, when one is established in R치g치tmika Bhakti from R치g치nug치 one enters the arena of Mohana Viji攷치na [Supra-aesthetic science of intimacy with the divine]. At that stage one is fascinated, one is charmed, and in that state, art, architecture, all come to an end; one뗩 verbosity stops, one becomes mute. This is R치g치tmik치 Bhakti.  \n\u003e So long as human beings are in the sphere of R치g치nug치 Bhakti they are in domestic life; they create arts, architecture, literature, painting, etc. and get pleasure in them. They are within the scope of aesthetic science (Nandana Viji攷치na). And what happens when they are established in supra-aesthetic science (Ati Nandan Viji攷치na)? All their worldly music is finished. All the R치gas and R치gi켻iis and the art of dancing, whatever they be, they come to an end. In that condition, there remains only an ecstatic state, (Bh치vibhora) The music of that state is called Kiirtana.\n\u003e \n\u003e  The Supreme Aesthetic Science and the Cult of Devotion, Subh치콑ita Sa拷쯚raha Part 19\n\n#### R치dh치 Bh치va\n\nOnce again as the kundalini rises the ensuing devotion state is described in terms of the history of the exquisitely charming childhood of Lord Krsna.\n\n\u003e And when it rises past the 치ji攷치 cakra, that is known as advaya bh치va or R치dh치 bh치va.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Kr콑켻a Unparalleled, Discourses on Kr콑켻a and the Giita\n\n#### Mah치bh치va\n\nOnce again this involves the transcendence of the last fetter of the Creative Principle (Shakti). As Shrii Sarkar explains,\n\n\u003e In the final phase, when he crosses the jurisdiction of the sentient principle, he feels that there is no duality, that is, the duality of him and his Lord, this duality, disappears. He feels there is only one existence  he feels 딷e is or he feels 땂he Lord is. I am with my Lord  I and Lord  this duality disappears. This is called mah치bh치va.  \n\u003e Now all higher sam치dhis are different experiences of this mah치bh치va. It depends on the style of ideation. But when one attains the stance of mah치bh치va it is not at all difficult or impossible for the aspirant to enjoy other kinds of sam치dhi. Not bh치va sam치dhi, but actual sam치dhi, that is, the highest form of sam치dhi.  \n\u003e But all those sam치dhis which are within the boundaries of the sentient principle are qualified sam치dhis, attributional sam치dhis. And the mind remains  either in the form of the microcosm or in the form of the Macrocosm, the ectoplasmic stuff is there. But when the aspirant brings his mind to a pointed form, to a pinnacled form, to an apexed form, the mind, the ectoplasmic stuff, disappears due to extreme concentration, and under such circumstances the Supreme Cognitive Faculty remains. This is called 랉on-qualified, non-attributional sam치dhi  nirvikalpa sam치dhi in Sanskrit.  \n\u003e By dint of japa kriy치, japa [mantra incantation with spiritual ideation], one attains the attributional stage of sam치dhi, and by dint of one뗩 Dhy치na [ideative absorption in the flow of the Lord] one attains the non-attributional stance of sam치dhi, which is the goal of each and every individual of this Universe. You should know it and you should do accordingly.\n\u003e \n\u003e  You Should Do Accordingly, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 12\n\nThe ecstasy of this state is explained thus:\n\n\u003e When the s치dhaka feels the closest proximity of Parama Puru콑a, even within his embrace, that bh치va is called mah치bh치va At the time of mah치bh치va, the s치dhaka feels the tactual presence of Parama Puru콑a and falls down. At that time, every nerve-cell, every nerve-fibre and every pore of the human body feels the divine touch.  \n\u003e The entire [extent] of the conscious, subconscious and unconscious minds becomes filled with devotion. But devotional expression is much more in the heart, the sentiment being strongly aroused. During floods, the rivers, tanks, pools, etc., all become filled and begin overflowing. Similarly, the mind and heart of the s치dhaka are filled to the brim with devotion when flooded by bh치va The s치dhaka feels waves of devotion in body, mind and heart, and feels so much proximity to God that he completely forgets his physical existence. At that time, the dh치ma, or stratum, where he moves mentally is Nitya Vrnd치vana or Vaeku켻t패ha.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Dasha, Bh치va and Mah치bh치va, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 33\n\n#### S치r콑t패hi Devotional Sam치dhi\n\nThe devotional bliss that results in the first stage of R치g치tmik치 Bhakti is known as S치r콑t패hi Sam치dhi. It is revealed in the following words:\n\n\u003e Then by still more s치dhan치, when the sleeping divinity crosses this point [between the eyebrows], the controlling point of the pituitary gland, the 치ji攷치 cakra, the s치dhaka뗩 feelings, or experiences  another sort of s치dhan치, still more high  are known as s치r콑t패hi in Sanskrit. At that point, the feeling is that I am He; that is, I and He, these two entities, have become one. I am; but He and I have coincided.  \n\u003e I  He. There is one gap. I am the Supreme Entity, I am the Supreme Entity. There is still the connecting link 따m. But when I and Supreme Entity coincide, the gap 따m disappears. I, Supreme Entity, and the connecting link 따m. When this will coincide with this, the connecting 따m will disappear, because there is no gap. I becomes one with He. Clear? Or He becomes one with I. This stage is called s치r콑t패hi.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Stages of Samadhi, Discourses on Tantra 1\n\n#### 5 Forms of Viveka\n\nWith the spiritual progress there arises the power of discriminating conscience. In the first stage one studies and meditates; in the second one analyses and intuits the positive and negative sides of an issue; and in the third stage you arrive at a decision whether a solution is blissful or non-blissful  whether it is helpful to the welfare of society or not. When one completes this whole process of logical reasoning, the outcome is our 라wakened conscience. This state of awakened conscience is what is called rationalistic mentality. This conscience is rooted in 5 main forms of spiritual and social conscience. Due to the importance of this for the Sadvipra뗩 ability to understand and liberate society these are quoted in detail below.\n\n\u003e Viveka (conscience) is a special kind of deliberation. Deliberation (vic치ra) is the endeavour to select a particular idea from several ideas. If a particular person is presented to you as a criminal, then there are two opposing ideas before you: the guilt of the man or his innocence. The process whereby one comes to a conclusion after deliberating upon these two opposing ideas is called vic치ra. When you finally make your decision it is called siddh치nta (conclusion).  \n\u003e Conscience (viveka) is defined as a special type of vic치ra (deliberation). The denotation of vic치ra is broader than that of viveka. A thief, on entering his victim뗩 house, considers whether it would be better to start stealing in the dining room or the sitting room. This is a kind of deliberation after which the thief reaches his conclusion. This deliberation is vic치ra and not viveka.  \n\u003e Viveka is that kind of deliberation where there is a conscious endeavour to decide in favour of shreya (benevolence) when confronted with the two opposing ideas of shreya and preya (malevolence). Viveka is of five types, and their collective name is viveka pai攷귺aka.  \n\u003e The first type is nity치nitya viveka (discrimination between permanent and impermanent). Whenever an intelligent person ponders over something, he or she discerns its two aspects  the permanent and the impermanent. The attempt to accept the permanent aspect after due deliberation is called nity치nitya viveka. The permanent is not dependent on the relative factors of time, space and person, whereas the impermanent is the collectivity of the relative factors. The best way to recognize the impermanent is that if one of the three relative factors is changed it will undergo an immediate transformation. Nity치nitya viveka enables human beings to realize the necessity of observing dharma. It helps them to understand the fundamental differences between dharma and religion, or doctrine. Religion is something entirely relative whereas dharma is a permanent truth.  \n\u003e The first characteristic of religion is that it gives excessive importance to a single individual. Different regions claim that such-and-such great personality (mah치puru콑a) is a son of God, a prophet, or even God himself. However wise these great persons might be, they are nevertheless mortal. Some also claim that the propounders of other religions could not come as close to God as their own propounder did. These words are not only irrational, but contain a concealed attempt to make the impermanent permanent. Dharma is an eternal truth credible and does not depend on any individual, prophet or avat치ra (direct descent of God) for its substantiation. The goal of dharma is the attainment of Brahma; its base and its movement are Brahma-centered. Brahma is the Absolute Entity independent of time, space and person; He is permanent. Brahma s치dhan치, therefore, is the s치dhan치 for the attainment of the permanent entity.  \n\u003e Through nity치nitya viveka, human beings become aware of the fleeting nature of transient objects. They observe that with change in time, place and person, corresponding changes occur in social, political, economic, and all other spheres of life take to which they have to adapt themselves. Those who are reluctant to adapt themselves to the changed circumstances are doomed to destruction. A religion or an 랄sm is created in a certain age which itself is a product of the three factors of time, place and person. However, the religion does not recognize the necessity of adjustment with the change in social life. It refuses to realize that the old rules and regulations of the previous age are now only mere historical records, having lost their relevance in the present dynamic society.  \n\u003e To stifle the progress of humanity, the followers of these religions play on human sentiments and other weaknesses. They want to perpetuate the hold of the vested interests by infusing an inferiority complex into the human mind. While preaching their religious ideas, some claim that the social, economic and political systems were direct creations of God and hence destined to be observed in all ages and all times with equal veneration. They pronounce that those who refuse to follow this divine decree will be doomed to burn in the scorching heat of God뗩 wrath, or dammed to suffer eternal hell-fire. To deny people the scope of verifying the rationality of different scriptures they declare that such-and-such scriptures are infallible and so nobody has the right to question their veracity. If the philosophical texts contradict the scriptures, then their propounders will be declared as atheists.  \n\u003e So it is seen that in the absence of nity치nitya viveka the propounders of religion want to thwart the intellectual progress of human society at large. They knowingly refuse to understand that any observation regarding the spatial, temporal and personal factors, from whatever person it might come, is bound to lose its relevance in a transformed situation.  \n\u003e Through nity치nitya viveka try to understand what is permanent and what is impermanent. You will certainly realize that no scripture is a revelation of God; that everything in this world created by time, space and individuality is transient phenomenon. For the transient body and the transient mind one cannot deny the necessity of transient mundane objects. Though these things are necessary, they are still transient.  \n\u003e In the introversive phase of the cosmic imagination, intellectual progress of human beings is bound to take place and consequently their control over matter will gradually increase. In the process of further intellectual development, the old ideas and values of the undeveloped life will become outdated. You must have noticed that people with old, outdated ideas very often lament that the present younger generation has no spiritual inclination whatsoever. Everything is lost, they lament. Perhaps they do not understand, or maybe knowingly refuse to believe that scientific knowledge is increasing, dramatically. Modern youth is becoming acquainted with newer inventions and discoveries. They are learning about many new things and accepting them from the core of their hearts. As a result, the intellectual backwardness of the past seems to be totally absurd to them. The more scientific knowledge they acquire (in the Pratisai攷귺ara movement of the Cosmic cycle they will certainly advance) the more they will try to liberate themselves from the noose of religion and 랄sms, and the further they will advance along the path of dharma directly, scientifically and supported by rational judgment. Are the proponents of isms not aware of this fact? They are well aware and that is why they deliberately criticize material science at every opportunity. But this sort of criticism does not impress intellectual people.  \n\u003e It is not enough to equate the so-called religious scriptures with transient philosophy. Rather, these scriptures are [even inferior to the] material science. Although the material sciences are still imperfect from the ideological and practical point of view, they do not stifle the scientific progress of humanity; though they do stifle subtle intellectual and spiritual progress. But the conniving religious theologies seek to shackle peoples feet, making them as static as static as birds sitting on a perch in a cage. Too often they are satisfied with the amount of scientific progress they inherit and do not care for further development. To them molasses is sacred whereas sugar made at the mill is unholy because it is a product of science. To them bullock carts and rowing boats are sacred whereas trains and steamers are unholy because they, too, are the products of science. And yet, if these proponents of religion think a little deeper, they will realize that both molasses and sugar are products of science. The age of molasses was an age of undeveloped science. Sugar was a product of a comparatively developed age.  \n\u003e We cannot advise today뗩 human beings to go back to the age of candles and oil lamps neglecting the electric light. But some religions impart such teachings. Human beings will have to understand the proper spirit of nity치nitya viveka and adjust themselves with the prevailing age. They will have to accept without reservation the situation of the particular age they are born into. It would not do to waste one뗩 time in unnecessarily gloating over the past.  \n\u003e Nity치nitya viveka is an inseparable part of the practice of dharma. Dharma lays down clear guidelines for moving ahead in perfect adjustment with the prevalent situation. Dharma is the throbbing vital faculty of living beings. In dharma there is no scope for the accumulated inertness of staticity.  \n\u003e Brahma alone is an Eternal Entity, and the s치dhan치 of Brahma is the real practice of dharma. The ritualistic observances centred around the spatial and temporal factors cannot help in attaining the Eternal Entity, Parama Brahma. The sustained effort for psychic purification is the only means to become one with Him. People who observe ostentatious rituals after indulging in various antisocial activities may be seen as righteous people from the religious point of view, but if they are tested in the touchstone of dharma their sinful nature will be revealed.  \n\u003e As religions are dependent upon various changing factors, they differ widely from one another. They criticize and mock each other, exaggerating the other뗩 defects and refusing to acknowledge the other뗩 positive qualities. As they have no Eternal Entity as their goal, they are influenced more by allegiance to their own sect than by any love for humanity. But real dharma teaches that all living beings of the universe belong to one family; all are bound by the common touch of fraternity. The entire universe is everyone뗩 homeland, and all the animate and inanimate entities are the various expressions of one and the same Supreme being.  \n\u003e Hararme Pit치 Gaorii M치t치 svadesha bhuvanatrayam.  \n\u003e [Parama Puru콑a is my Father, Parama Prakrti is my Mother, and the entire universe is my home.]  \n\u003e But strangely enough, many religions teach the opposite. They proclaim the exclusive greatness of a particular country, race, mountain or river. But in dharma there is no scope for intolerance, for Dharma is based on the solid foundation of vigour derived from universal love. The goal of religion is a non-integral entity and as such there remains a narrow outlook. The goal of dharma, however, is infinite Brahma. So the pursuit of dharma increasingly expands one뗩 vision. Sometimes a kind of alliance is noticed between religions but that is entirely an external alliance. The talk of synthesis of religions is totally absurd; it is merely an apparent show of honesty and grandiloquence to hoodwink the common people. Dharma is always singular in number, and never plural. So there is no question of religious synthesis in dharma. Religion is always plural in number  never singular. The synthesis of religions means their annihilation. Where impermanent entities are worshipped as the goal through various ritualistic paraphernalia, there is no scope for synthesis.  \n\u003e Religion is practiced for the fulfilment of mundane aspirations. This is the reason why a class of clergymen emerged centring around the religion. Ultimately the adherents of these religions become mere tools in the hands of vested interests. With the awakening of nity치nitya viveka in human minds and the opening of the door of scientific knowledge, it will not be possible to deceive the people in the name of religion or by holding out the lure of happiness in the next world. The vested interests are quite aware of this fact and hence strive to keep the masses lost in the darkness of ignorance. Like parasites, they manoeuvre themselves to misappropriate, by injecting fear and inferiority complexes, a lion뗩 share of what the ignorant masses earn with their sweat and blood.  \n\u003e Religious exploiters maintain an unholy alliance with the capitalistic exploiters. With hands upraised, a religious preceptor blesses the wealthy merchants for their future prosperity but refuses to see the faces of his poor disciples who fail to provide handsome pra켻치mii (a fee for the priest뗩 blessing). You will notice that in many religions mythological stories and fables are given more importance than science and rational ideas because they contain ample scope for exploitation of human weaknesses.  \n\u003e But in scientific and rational analyses, there is no scope for exploitation. If you consider yourself a Br치hmin by caste, then you will have to admit indirectly that the Br치hmins had their origin from the mouth of a god named Brahma [Hindu god]. But will your scientific intellect agree to this sort of irrational interpretation? Likewise, if you consider yourself as a warrior (k콑atriya) or a merchant (vaeshya) or a labourer (sh칰dra), then you will have to accept that you were born of Brahma뗩 hands, thighs or legs. Anthropology, archaeology and human history can not accept these absurd notions. But the adherents of so many religions have to conform, more or less, to some mythological stories, which are totally contrary to science. By developing nity치nitya viveka you will be able to clean your mind of the garbage caused by such superstitions with little effort. Nity치nitya viveka teaches that the entities which are dependent on time, place and person are all transient. The only entity beyond the scope of time, place and person, is Param치tma, so He is the Eternal one, Nitya拷 Vastreka拷 Brahma [Eternal, Singular Substance that is Consciousness].  \n\u003e The second type of viveka pai攷귺aka is dvaet치dvaeta viveka. Through dvaet치dvaeta viveka one gains the capacity to analyse whether the eternal entity is one or more than one and come to a conclusion accordingly (dvaeta means dualistic and advaeta means non-dualistic). There cannot remain any svagata [differences within the same unit being], svaj치tiiya [differences within the same species] and vij치tiiya[differences between species] differentiation in the entity which is beyond time, space and person. So it is not possible for the Eternal Entity to be more than one. Various beliefs about the so-called gods  that one god defeated another in battle, but was later harmed enormously by his adversary뗩 wrathful vengeance; that a certain god spreads or cures a certain disease; and that another god distributes wealth or learning  are contrary to Dvaet치dvaeta Viveka. In spiritual practice nity치nitya viveka is not enough, Dvaet치dvaeta viveka is also necessary. For success in spiritual practice both nity치nitya viveka and dvaet치dvaeta viveka are indispensable. They enable people to realize that all the objects bound by time, space and individuality are transient while the Entity beyond the periphery of time, space and individuality is permanent; It is one without a second.  \n\u003e The third type of conscience is 치tm치n치tma viveka (literally self-non-self conscience). The role of this type of conscience is to analyse whether the Permanent, Non-dualistic Entity is Consciousness (츼tmabh치va) or non-consciousness (an치tmabh치va).  \n\u003e Everything in this universe is a metamorphosed form of Consciousness. This metamorphosis takes place due to the influence of static principle. The creation of the world of forms by the static principle continues as a result of the changes in the flow of endless waves. Forms are the expressions of the formless due to the influence of the static Prakrti. So Consciousness, in the process of crudification, is turned into solid matter and takes the form of a perceptible object, relinquishing its original quality of witness-ship. That is, Consciousness (츼tmabh치va) becomes metamorphosed into non-consciousness (an치tmabh치va). From mind to solid matter there is the domination of non-consciousness and hence the existence of the three factors: knower, knowledge, and knowable. When spiritual aspirants apply 치tm치n치tma viveka they can easily discern these three factors and come to the realization that all the three are changeable and perceptible and hence non-consciousness by nature. And the entity which is above these three factors, which is One without a second, which is the Witnessing Entity, is nothing but Consciousness.  \n\u003e In the mundane world people run after money. What is the nature of this money? Money is important to buy crude physical objects. It is not a conscious entity; it is non-consciousness. Its necessity is felt by the unit mind. Money is knowable and enjoyable, and the pleasure derived from money is enjoyment. But, being non-consciousness, it cannot be the cause of unlimited happiness. Yet people will do almost anything to attain money: bribery, murder, adulteration, black marketing, hypocrisy and so on. Such people are the worshipers of non-consciousness, investing all their vital energy in the pursuit of matter.  \n\u003e Apply 치tm치n치tman viveka in all action and all thoughts. Atm치n치tma viveka has a greater importance in the field of action than dvaet치dvaeta viveka. If you utilize it as an indispensable part of your daily life, the true form of the universe will appear before you. Of course, this will never happen if one harbours sinful thoughts while pretending to be righteous. 츼tm치n치tman viveka will teach you that the Singular Eternal Entity in the form of Consciousness should be your only object of ideation. You will see the colours of religion fade before your eyes as the pure white effulgence of dharma shines with ever-increasing brilliance.  \n\u003e All the 딸sms prevalent in today뗩 world can easily be included in the category of religions. All the defects of religions exist in the 랄sms too. None of the political, social or economic 딸sms are free from superstition none are straightforward; all are full of rampant hypocrisy. In all 딸sms, doctrines and religions, the scriptural authority is supreme. There is no scope for the functioning of the five types of conscience, no place for service, love or devotion. With the help of falsehood and immorality, these 딸sms, doctrines and religions slander and make accusations against each other. They make attractive promises to the people while hiding their own internal sins. In fact, false piety is not the path of dharma, leading to welfare, but the opposite of dharma, the negation of welfare. They can be likened to asses wearing lion skins: take away the lion skins and their their true form will be revealed. They have no other purpose than to grab votes and usurp power. The mentality to grab the votes first and then serve the people is not the true spirit of selfless social service; rather, it is the mentality of power craving materialists.  \n\u003e You will have to advance with the true spirit of genuine social service, because the very characteristic of Dharma is to promote the cause of welfare. Dharma and welfare are inseparable. Religion and intolerance have created enormous harm in the world, have caused torrents of blood to stain the rivers red. In the present twentieth century, religions have assumed the form of 딸sms.  \n\u003e The people of medieval times fought among the clans and communities, and the people of today are fighting over their 딸sms. Just as religions did in the past, the 랄sms are criticizing each other today, betraying their spirit of intolerance as they try to gag each other뗩 voices. It seems that they have no other goal than carping, criticizing, and slandering each other. They are befooling the ignorant masses by painting rosy pictures of service, peace and happiness. On the other hand they themselves are going far away from the path of selfless service and welfare. To emancipate the masses from the unhealthy influence of 딸sms there is no other way than universalism. Only universalism is free from the defects of any narrow 딸sms because every thing of this entire universe comes within its vast periphery.  \n\u003e It is only with the help of 치tm치n치tma viveka that the human beings can emerge from the mire of the present century and move towards universalism with firm steps. By virtue of 치tm치n치tma viveka people can realize that Brahma is the Eternal Singular Entity, pure Consciousness.  \n\u003e The fourth type of conscience is pai攷귺ako콑a viveka (the conscience of pai攷귺ako콑as or five layers of existence). People sometimes mistake the different layers of their existence to be unit consciousness. With the help of pai攷귺ako콑a viveka people can easily discern that the annamaya ko콑a (physical body), kamamaya ko콑a (crude mind) manomaya ko콑a (subtle mind), atimanas, viji攷치namaya, and hiranyamaya ko콑as(causal mind) are separate layers, and that Consciousness is above all five ko콑as. Spiritual s치dhan치 means ideation on one뗩 own consciousness beyond these ko콑as and not ideation on any of the ko콑as themselves. Through knowledge one must analyse and stop worshipping these ko콑as. Movement towards consciousness is the real spirit of s치dhan치. It is not possible to follow the spiritual cult without properly cultivating pai攷귺ako콑a viveka.  \n\u003e Take for example the case of a major problem in society  the problem of food and clothes. Food and clothes are essential for the preservation of human existence, but they are not the goal of life. They are necessary for the physical body (annamaya ko콑a), and to some extent for other ko콑as too, but they are not everything. With them it is not possible to achieve complete mundane fulfilment. To attain supreme benevolence the microcosmic entity consisting of the five ko콑as is a necessity, and for that there is the need of food and clothes. But the struggle for procuring food and clothes is only a crude stage of s치dhan치 not the final and absolute one. Those whose entire s치dhan치 is employed only for procuring food and clothes can hardly be called human beings; they are better described as undeveloped animals.  \n\u003e Mah치v치kya viveka, the fifth stage of conscience, is the resultant of the other four. The first four types of conscience help a sadhaka to realize that the Eternal Entity, Brahma, is One without a second, Consciousness personified, and the knower of the five ko콑as. Mah치v치kya viveka teaches human beings that He is not attainable through mere knowledge. To liberate the consciousness from these five ko콑as, action and devotion are indispensable. Those who think that He is attainable through the cult of knowledge alone are mistaken. By cultivating the first four types of conscience a person of knowledge may become established in mah치v치kya viveka. At that stage he or she realizes that the mere pursuit of knowledge cannot bring param치rtha (the means of attaining the supreme goal). He or she then understands that the knowledge already acquired is not true knowledge because it leads to vanity.  \n\u003e If ignorant people want to acquire more knowledge they should be encouraged to do so. But if so-called intellectuals (ji攷치niis), puffed up with the vanity of knowledge, want to attain more knowledge they should be told to perfect the cult of action and devotion first, thereby smashing their vanity. So let the ji攷치nii tell the masses that Brahma is attainable only through self surrender, proper questioning and selfless service.  \n\u003e Pr치nip치tena, pariprashnena, sevay치. Keep serving the people, and as you render service ascribe Brahmahood to those you are serving. Try to make them happy with all the sweetness of your heart. Help others with the true spirit of service, not with the intention of propagating your self or group interests or any 랄sm you may adhere to. Think that the Supreme Entity has come to you in the form of needy people to test your sense of duty. This sort of selfless service is karma yoga. Your only motivation for service should be to promote the welfare of suffering people. Those who serve the poor in order to convert them in some way, or those political opportunists who serve them to get their votes with a view to becoming ministers, are not the true benefactors of human society, but the devious traders.  \n\u003e Along with service, spiritual aspirants should also cultivate pariprashnena (proper questioning). When a spiritual aspirant follows the path of the spirituality, so many questions, doubts, and confusions arise in the mind. Pariprashnena is asking questions to the right people who will provide appropriate answers to help one solve any problem one may encounter on the spiritual path. This permits one to advance more rapidly towards the spiritual goal. Through the cultivation of the five stages of conscience all questions are easily answered. One who does not follow the spiritual path, or one who does not develop the five-fold conscience, remains constantly preoccupied with the material objects of enjoyment.  \n\u003e Together with selfless service and proper questioning, pra켻ip치tena, or complete surrender, is also essential. Cultivate knowledge and render service unto others to the best of your capacity, but do not think that this will suffice; for your small-I still exists. You must surrender your small I to the Cosmic I: this is the spirit of pranip치tena. That is why it is said that the five types of conscience attain their consummation through ji攷치na yoga, karma yoga and bhakta yoga.  \n\u003e So, the five types of conscience begin with nity치nitya viveka and terminate in devotion.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Subh치콑ita Sa拷쯚raha Part 6\n\n#### NeoHumanism\n\nThe development of oneself into a viira or hero enables one to develop universalism in the collective mind. As Shrii Sarkar explains wondrously,\n\n\u003e The second stage [of Neo-Humanism] is spiritual essence. This stage is related mainly to the psychic and spiritual strata. If you consider the entire human race, you will see that humanity has a collective mind (not the Cosmic Mind). Now, changes will have to be effected in the mental flow of this collective mind; you will have to create a new wave of thought in it. Because of the manner of human thinking thus far, the pace of human progress has been painfully slow. If it is given a new direction, the speed of progress will be greatly accelerated.  \n\u003e Thus we find that the second stage, that of spiritual essence, will take place in the psychic and spiritual realms; it will occur in the collective psychic mind, in the collective ectoplasm of all humanity. Then the global thought processes of humanity will take an entirely new turn, and that will also strengthen humanity뗩 collective spirit. Humanity as a whole will become converted into a powerful spiritual force, and in that stage, no pseudo-humanistic strategy will work. All other 치stras [weapons] will become completely powerless before this Brahm치stra [mightiest spiritual weapon].\n\nThis form of spirituality is dependent on the realization of Lord Shiva뗩 social mission of sama-sam치ja tattva. As Shrii Sarkar explains,\n\n\u003e The basis of this proto-spiritualistic mentality is sama-sam치ja tattva [the principle of social equality]. When people understand this principle from the core of their hearts, they spontaneously develop proto-spiritualistic mentality, proto-spiritualistic psychic structure. So this sama-sam치ja tattva is very necessary to fight against socio-sentiment. There is no other way.  \n\u003e If one avoids this sama-sam치ja tattva and thinks, I will be a virtuous person, I will be a devotee of the Lord, I will do all sorts of good deeds  but I will not raise my voice against injustice, I must say that will be foolish. Trying to do good while avoiding this sama-sam치ja tattva is just like placing the cart before the horse. The cart should be placed behind the horse; it is foolish to place it in front  \n\u003e Once a person is established in this proto-spiritualistic flow, what happens within his or her mind? Devotion as a cult is transformed into devotion as a principle. Only at this stage, when devotion becomes a principle, can one fight against socio-sentiment.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Bondages and Solutions, The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism\n\nHowever, many will wonder how can an ordinary human being influence the collective mind. The answer lies in the form of a Hari Parima켻d패ala Go콑t패i. Hari means the Lord who lovingly steals the devotee뗩 sins and Parima켻d패ala means 란nvironment. Ma켻d패ala literally means a 띾ircle. It also refers to a Tantric symbol that drawn on the ground. When one sits on this and meditates it creates a powerful spiritual charge in a person. Here is referring to such a spiritual charged environment. Go콑t패i means a 랁ellowship, partnership or meeting. Shrii Sarkar explains it thus:\n\n\u003e Whenever the devotees of Hari assemble together they do not like to gossip, but prefer to do Hari kiirtana, and nothing else. Whoever comes within the circumference of that spiritual gathering will certainly feel an irresistible desire to participate in that spiritual dance. The sweet spiritual environment created by the kiirtana is called Hariparima켻d패ala in the scriptures. Hari resides at its nucleus.  \n\u003e Those in the Hariparima켻d패ala are by nature devotional. When they participate in the kiirtana they become even more devotional. Whenever Hariparima켻d패ala is created, be it for five minutes, three hours or twenty-four hours, due to the intense collective devotion, the environment becomes so sweet and blissful that it becomes highly congenial for spiritual ideation (dhy치na). At that time Hari moves His nucleus there and becomes the focal point of dhy치na, the object of ideation.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Hari Pari Ma켻d패ala, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 7\n\nKiirtana is singing the Name of the Lord, calling out to Him with Love. Today the primary mantra for Kiirtana is B치b치 N치ma Kevalam [the Name of the Beloved, of the Supreme Father alone exists  is the sole Reality]. Kiirtana is an 8 syllabled mantra that rapidly raises the Kundalini (spiritual force at the base of the spine). Due to the spiritual vibrations generated by Kiirtana it is often found to remedy all kinds of calamities. It remove mental and emotional afflictions also.\n\nNow the question will surely arise  just exactly what does spiritual singing have to do with social change and social revolution? In the early 16th Century in Navadviipa (Nadia, Bengal) Caitanya led a Kiirtana revolution against an oppressive Muslim religious official. Thousands of people sung and danced and fearlessly confronted the soldiers who became afraid.\n\nIn reality, battles are won and revolutions take place because of sentiment. Kiirtana generates tremendous emotional and sentimental power. However, being spiritual it is not polluted by the crudity and violence of mob psychology. This is why Shrii Sarkar says,\n\n\u003e You have obtained a human form for this purpose; and your body will be fully utilized when you have reached the closest proximity to the Supreme Consciousness.  \n\u003e Why? When you reach the closest proximity the Supreme Consciousness, your mental waves will come in contact with His mental waves. Then you will understand what is to be done, and what will be the destiny of humanity in the near and distant future.  \n\u003e Thus the solution to all problems lies in Neohumanism.  \n\u003e We can bring Neohumanism into the objective world from the subjective world when our minds develop love for the Supreme Consciousness. And to arouse this love for Him, human beings must do s치dhan치 in the subjective world, they must enter into its deeper regions.  \n\u003e I have already said, and I repeat it again, that now the time has come to manifest the glory of kiirtana.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Spirituality and This Panoramic Universe, Neohumanism in a Nutshell Part 2\n\n#### PROUT\n\nThus in the viira stage we see the primary responsibility of the Proutist is to unite the people with samaja sentiment based on NeoHumanism and devotional love. The primary reason for the failure of revolutions and movements is the disunity among the people. To create a powerful emotional flow in the collective heart based on universalism is a tremendous but crucial task. Only a heroic personality in the spiritual realm can achieve this. Then alone can a non-prejudice, non-discriminatory samaja movement be created.\n\nHowever even this is not enough to establish PROUT, one has to freely risk one뗩 life for one뗩 ideology. Shrii Sarkar has said, Live for your Ideology, Die for your ideology. He has also said that suffering caused by courageous fight against exploitation is in fact our asset  it is to be treasured. This alone will generate courage in other activists and among the general public. Those who have the courage to single-handedly tackle a mob or the police rouse courage in the public and infuse the Proutists with determined zeal such that they feel,\n\n\u003e If by following the ideology, the older people become unhappy or condemn me, I will not care. If by following the ideology, I die and die again, let it be. I will not care. I will stick to my ideology.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Ideology, Goal and Devotion, Subh치콑ita Sa拷쯚raha Part 20\n\nIt must not be forgotten that this revolutionary fight against injustice is not a burdensome responsibility. Rather, it is the joy of being truly alive  the joy of being a genuine human being of all our noblest dreams. Shrii Sarkar reveals what we all know in our hearts to be so true,\n\n\u003e There is joy indeed in launching a struggle against injustice, and that joy is part and parcel of aesthetic science.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Discourse 26, Nam치mi Kr콑켻asundaram\n\nWe are in the 21st Century and we cannot afford to be content with an ordinary revolution. We need a revolution in all aspects of human existence. This is what PROUT calls Nuclear Revolution.\n\n\u003e PROUT advocates another type of revolution called 랉uclear revolution. In nuclear revolution, every aspect of collective life  social, economic, political, cultural, psychic and spiritual  is completely transformed. New moral and spiritual values arise in society which provide the impetus for accelerated social progress. The old era is replaced by a new era  one collective psychology is replaced by another. This type of revolution results in all-round development and social progress.  \n\u003e Nuclear revolution can only be brought about by sadvipras who reside in the nucleus of the social cycle. Through their concerted effort, moral and spiritual power and all-round endeavour, they mobilize the exploited sections of society to overthrow the ruling class  the exploiters. This very struggle for mass upheaval liberates society from exploitation and ushers in a new era of peace and prosperity.  \n\u003e Sadvipras will control the key points at the nucleus of the social structure. In nuclear revolution, there is minimum loss of life and property, and the transformation of society is accomplished within a very short span of time.  \n\u003e There are several requirements for the success of nuclear revolution  the presence of exploitation in any form, revolutionary organization, positive philosophy, revolutionary cadres, infallible leadership and revolutionary strategy. All these requirements are necessary  \n\u003e PROUT is based on a universal sentiment which is applicable for the whole cosmological order, and it is systematically moving towards the implementation of this sentiment. Who will make the local people conscious of their local sentiments keeping universalism in mind? Only PROUT can do this  \n\u003e Communists have no such idea. Only PROUT can tackle all local sentiments and lead everyone in the world to universalism by gradual stages.  \n\u003e Revolutionaries must be well-versed in arousing the sentiments of the people and channelizing the sentimental legacy of the society towards universalism. During the preparation for revolution, unstinting effort must go into arousing the sentimental legacy of the people, because sentiments inspire popular support for the cause of revolution, and infuse the revolutionary workers with tremendous power and conviction.  \n\u003e According to PROUT, there are two types of sentiments  positive sentiments and negative sentiments. Positive sentiments are synthetic in nature. They unite society and elevate humanity, enhance collective interests and encourage progressive development. Negative sentiments are narrow in scope and divide society.  \n\u003e Some important positive sentiments include anti-exploitation sentiment, revolutionary sentiment, moral sentiment, cultural sentiment, universal sentiment and spiritual sentiment. Some negative sentiments include communalism, patriotism, nationalism, provincialism, lingualism and racism.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Nuclear Revolution, Prout in a Nutshell Volume 4 Part 21\n\nTo understand further the spiritual dimension of nuclear revolution we can read the awe-inspiring words of Shrii Sarkar:\n\n\u003e In essence, revolution means controlling all the three nuclei of the universe  physical, psychic and spiritual.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Talks on PROUT, Prout in a Nutshell Volume 3 Part 15\n\nTo accomplish such an awesome task requires more than heroism  it requires divine energy. And the practices of Viira Sadhana described above all serve to transform a hero or viira into a divine entity or deva.\n\n#### Your Mission\n\nLet us study what is the mission of such divine personalities. For the purpose of achieving enlightenment or a divine state of existence is not to enjoy bliss but to create a spiritual upsurge and above all rouse the moralists to fight the exploiters. Let us meditate on these words of Shrii Sarkar:\n\n\u003e Your duty will be to unite the moralists. Let there be two camps. Let there be an open fight. The moralists have been scattered for so long that they could not fight. The united strength of five moralists is much more than the united strength of a hundred immoralists because there is an unholy alliance amongst the latter. Meditation behind closed doors will not do. Gather strength by intuitional practices and unite yourselves against the immoralists.  \n\u003e So your duty is three-fold. Your first duty is to observe morality and to do intuitional practices. Without this you cannot have mental determination. Your next duty is to unite the moralists of the world, otherwise Dharma will not endure. The exploited mass who do not observe Yama and Niyama  the cardinal moral principles  cannot fight against their own sense of frustration. It is therefore necessary to unite the moralists. This will be your real Dharma. You will become great by doing this, because ideation of the Great makes a person great. At the third stage, you will have to mercilessly fight against sin wherever it has taken root in this world.  \n\u003e You will have to propagate this mission from door to door. No political party or so-called religious institution can bring salvation. Praising God in concerts with drums and cymbals will not bring salvation either, because this will not bring the sinner to submission. To curb the onslaughts of the immoralists today, arms are more necessary than drums and cymbals.  \n\u003e It is not possible to fight against sin as long as there is some weakness in your mind. In this fight, your goal is not the sin or the sinner, your goal is the Supreme Consciousness. Anything that comes in the way of this has to be removed mercilessly. When clouds collect around the pole-star and cover it, your duty will be to remove the clouds and follow the pole-star without caring to see where the clouds have gone. If you always think of your enemy, your mind will adopt the bad qualities of your object of ideation, but if the Supreme Being is your goal, your mind will be metamorphosed into the Supreme Being itself.  \n\u003e Remember  you have to serve humanity. You have to dedicate yourself to the cause of humanity as a whole. Your life is valuable; your time is all the more valuable. You should not waste a single moment. The task is glorious. The task is novel. Lead the life of a warrior and constantly fight against evils. You will be victorious. So march ahead!\n\u003e \n\u003e  Your Mission, Prout in a Nutshell Part 18","lastmodified":"2023-05-22T03:06:06.349499394Z","tags":["sadvipra"]},"/notes/THE-FORGING-OF-THE-SADVIPRA-3-DEVA":{"title":"The Forging Of The Sadvipra 3","content":"[[sadvipra]]\nHow do we define a Tantric as a Deva or divine personality  what are the external criteria. Shrii Sarkar explains:\n\n\u003e When ideology is totally reflected in a personality, that very personality is worshipped as a divine personality, a god. Ordinary people follow His instructions; they want to be guided by His will, because they experience bliss by moving in this way.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Discourse 5, Namah Shiv치ya Sh치nt치ya\n\nAnother criteria is that one has transcended the ripus and pashas.\n\n\u003e One who has overcome fear, who has gone beyond fear, is called a divy치c치rii. And the divy치c치rii who successfully defeats the ripus and the p치shas and, rising above petty selfishness, identifies himself or herself with the collective interest, becomes one with ParamaPuru콑a. This gradual movement towards the supreme goal is the path of Tantra. It is a safe path where there is no scope for fear. And the naturalness of human life is not impaired under any circumstances.  \n\u003e The Tantric s치dhan치 introduced by Sad치shiva was the first s치dhan치 to be given in this world. Tantra s치dhan치 is the only s치dhan치. Without s치dhan치 there is no Tantra and without Tantra there is no s치dhan치.\n\u003e \n\u003e  The Fundamental Difference between Veda and Tantra, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 5\n\nAnother way is that one becomes like one뗩 Parame콑t패in Guru (Lord Shiva, Lord Krsna or Lord Anandamurti).\n\n\u003e _Kramena devat치 bhavet_. One becomes God in due course. That is, one attains godhood. Rising step by step from viira bh치va (heroic stance), one becomes a veritable god and reaches divya bh치va. We call such a person whose conduct becomes ever noble, a godly person or a Shiva-like person. Such a person proceeds far along the path of evolution and one day merges in Parama Puru콑a, and becomes Parama Puru콑a Himself. These are the different stages of spiritual practice.\n\u003e \n\u003e  The Three Stages of Spiritual Progress, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 4\n\nStill another way to define someone as a divine personality is their character. As Shrii Sarkar explains:\n\n\u003e _Sarve ca pashavah santi talavad bh칰tale nar치h;  \n\u003e Te콑치拷 ji攷치na prak치sh치ya viirabh치vah prak치shitah.  \n\u003e Viirabh치va拷 sad치 pr치pya krame켻a devat치 bhavet._먹Rudray치mala Tantra  \n\u003e [In the beginning everyone is a pashu, an animal. But when spiritual thirst develops, these people become viira, heroic. And when they are firmly established in viirabh치va, they become devat치s.]  \n\u003e And that man is no longer known as viira. He is a deva, or devat치. Krame켻a devat치 bhavet. He becomes devat치, he becomes deva in human structure, deva in human framework. That stage is divyabh치va. Then that person뗩 goal, his object of adoration, becomes Mah치deva, not Viireshvara but Mah치deva.  \n\u003e In the first phase the Lord was Pashupati, in the second phase Viireshvara, and in the final phase Mah치deva. So the same Lord, according to one뗩 own psycho-spiritual stratum, is to be addressed sometimes as Pashupati, sometimes as Viireshvara, and sometimes as Mah치deva. Now, I have said that a person has three types of expression: One expression is thinking, the thinking faculty, and the second one is speaking In the first the function is within the nerve cells, and in the second, the function is  where? With the lips. And the third action is action with the physical body, corporal action.  \n\u003e And in the final stage, that is, when one attains the stage of devat치, then what one thinks, one says; and what one says, one does. There is no difference amongst thinking, saying, and doing. And that is the best stage of human structure or human existence.  \n\u003e You should all try to be like this, and I want the number of such persons, who have attained the stratum of devat치, to increase. And you have become workers, or wholetimers, just to increase the number of these devat치s in human society.\n\u003e \n\u003e  From Animality to Divinity, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 1\n\nIn this supreme fight of a godly Tantric or Sadvipra, weapons are crucial as we have seen before when learning what is their Mission. This is why Shrii Sarkar explains,\n\n\u003e And as a result of further fight, when this fighting tendency, this belligerent tendency, becomes his wont, in that case He becomes a deva, he is called a deva.  \n\u003e _Dyotate kriid패ate yasm치dudyate dyotate divi;  \n\u003e Tasm치t deva iti proktah st칰yate sarvadevataeh._  \n\u003e [The vibrational manifestations emanating from the Supreme Nucleus are known as devat치s or devas; and these devat치s address that Supreme Nucleus as (Mah치)deva. He with His powers vibrates the entire universe, makes the entire universe dance; and He by dint of His occult and supra-occult powers brings everything back onto His lap.]  \n\u003e So he becomes a deva. And he says: O Lord, by Your mercy I have become a deva, a god. (Deva means 랂od in human structure.) ㄹnd Thou art my Lord, Thou art Mah치deva. So in the third stage that very Lord becomes Mah치deva. Pashupati becomes Viireshvara, Viireshvara becomes Mah치deva  according to the status or phase of s치dhan치 of the spiritual aspirant.  \n\u003e Now, this fight, this fight against the eccentric force fighting, eccentric force functioning, in the world, is actually the s치dhan치. You know, in each and every structure, there are two forces, the centripetal force and the centrifugal force. In the case of this Cosmological world, in the case of this Cosmological system, in the case of this Brahma Cakra, the centripetal force, the centre-seeking force, is called vidy치, and the centrifugal force is called avidy치. So this spiritual practice, or intuitional practice, is a fight between vidy치 and avidy치. A s치dhaka is to strengthen his vidy치, his centripetal force, in his movement towards the nave of this Cosmological order, towards the nucleus of this Cosmological order  because of the fact that this Cosmological nucleus is the nucleus of all other nuclei of the universe. It is the abode of supreme beatitude. All other nuclei of the universe are sheltered in Him. (That뗩 why he is called N치r치ya켻a. Ayana means 랍helter. And N치ra means Operative Principle.) There is no other way. If one wants peace of permanent nature, if one has developed the longing for supreme beatitude, one has no alternative but to move towards this Supreme Nucleus; and this movement is s치dhan치. And while moving towards this Supreme Nucleus, one will have to fight against the centrifugal force, the avidy치 shakti.  \n\u003e In this fight against avidy치 shakti one must have sufficient weapons. You know, a soldier requires weapons, and s치dhan치 is a fight. In your internal sphere, that is, in your mind, you should have ten weapons. Those ten weapons are five Yama and five Niyama [moral principles]. And similarly, while fighting against evil forces in this crude physicality, you should have ultra-modern physical weapons also. Those who want disarmament and those who want to ban the atom bomb are not friends of human society. They do not want to accelerate the speed of human society. Rather they want to retard its progress. Weapons you must have, but you should have control over your body and mind. There must not be any abuse or misuse of your weapons.  \n\u003e Now, in this progress, that is, in the realm of intuitionalism, you should have ten internal weapons  Yama and Niyama  and your progress in s치dhan치 depends on ji攷치na [wisdom], karma [service work] and bhakti [devotion]. Your progress is effected by ji攷치na and karma.\n\u003e \n\u003e  I Have Become a Hero, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 34\n\nDespite this, even divine personalities can be defeated. Hence they require Divine Grace at every step.\n\n\u003e And in the final phase they attain godhood step by step. Here the struggle is purely internal, controlling the debasing propensities of the mind one by one. Now the aspirants are called devas or divine beings, and their course of action is known as divy치c치r치. In the first phase there may be some physical obstacles, but these can be surmounted by the Grace of the Lord. In the second phase, too, there are mental obstacles, but they too can be overcome by the Grace of the Lord. For He clearly says:  \n\u003e Daevii hye콑치 gu켻amayii mama M치y치 duratyay치;  \n\u003e M치meva ye prapadyante M치y치met치拷 taranti te.  \n\u003e This M치y치, this depraving faculty, this avidy치 shakti, is my M치y치: she is under my control  Shakti s치 shivasya shaktih. So those spiritual aspirants who have surrendered at the altar of the Supreme need not be afraid of M치y치 because the Lord before whom they have surrendered controls that very M치y치. Daeviiye콑a gu켻amayii mama M치y치 duratyay치: This M치y치 of mine is insurmountable. But M치meva ye prapadyante  Those who have taken shelter in Me  M치y치met치拷 taranti te  랑ill easily surmount this M치y치. So spiritual aspirants need not be afraid of this M치y치: She can do nothing because the Lord is with them. In pashv치c치ra and viir치c치ra, they are helped by the Lord to fight against M치y치.  \n\u003e What is divy치c치r치? From the root div comes the word deva which means vibrational faculty, vibrational manifestation. The Supreme Cause is noumenal: from It emerges the vibrational faculty and the entire universe. All the manifestations are nothing but a mesh of so many vibrations of so many wavelengths, and thus there is variety in this world. Pra karoti iti Prakrti  prak치ra拷 karoti iti Prakrti.  \n\u003e Now in the third phase the spiritual aspirants become one with a particular expression, and slowly they move towards the nucleus of the universe that controls all the vibrations. If a particular vibration is called a deva, the Supreme Controlling Faculty of the devas is called Mah치deva: Tvamiishvar치켻a拷 paramam Maheshvara拷 Mah치deva. Finally the spiritual aspirants become one with the nucleus, and then they control all those vibrational expressions, all those devas  then they themselves become Mah치deva.\n\u003e \n\u003e The Essence of Spiritual Progress\n\nThose who are divine personalities no longer look towards the great personalities of the past or present for guidance. Rather they solely focus on that Supreme Divinity from which all divine entities emanate and are pervaded.\n\n\u003e In the third phase, the aspirant realizes the fact that the human entity is more a spiritual one than a psychic entity. And in this third phase they feel that the lord of all emanating vibrations or emanated vibrations is the supreme Mah치deva. He is the only goal, He is the only desideratum of human beings, and especially of intellectual beings.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Parama Puru콑a the Great\n\nSuch divine personalities are not content with their divine state or with their revolutionary activities. Rather they are ever-filled with longing for the Supreme Beloved Lord.\n\n\u003e In the final or spiritual sphere, the rhythm of speed is on the spiritual level. In the spiritual sphere there is only one cause for grief: My Parama Puru콑a is my own. He is my Father. And yet there is such a distance between Him and me. This distance is painful and unbearable for the s치dhaka. This stage is called 띿ivy치c치ra or 띿ivyabh치va in Tantra. In this stage, Parama Puru콑a is called Mah치deva or Dev치dideva  the God of gods. At this level the sadhaka becomes a deva, a vibrational existence. The s치dhaka can vibrate the world, can create a vibration in the universe, and is thus a deva. The s치dhaka capable of creating vibrations calls Parama Puru콑a by the name of Mah치deva. Mah치deva is another name of Shiva  \n\u003e Deva means a vibrational force, and the collective vibrational force, or vibrational rays, are known as Mah치deva. He controls all the devas, all the vibrational forces in the universe, and thus He is Mah치deva.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Pashupati, Viireshvara, and Mah치deva\n\n#### Vashiik치ra\n\nWe have seen thus far the first three stages of Praty치h치ra. The final stage of this process of introversion and submersion in one뗩 innermost Self is vashiik치ra. Finally the devotee transcends the ripus and pashas.\n\n\u003e The p치shas and ripus assert themselves through the medium of the mind and the indriyas. If even one indriya remains uncontrolled, it should be concluded that there is still a worm in the flower of the mind; and a worm-eaten flower cannot be offered to the Lord. Only when all the indriyas are fully controlled can it be said that the mind is under the complete control of the 치tman [unit consciousness]. This is real praty치h치ra, or vashiik치ra siddhi, for it means Prakrti has merged into the Supreme Cognitive Principle. This is called Kr콑켻ashara켻a [taking the shelter of Kr콑켻a] in devotional psychology.  \n\u003e The importance of praty치h치ra s치dhan치 is immense, because it involves a harmonious blending of knowledge, devotion and action뵜ashiik치ra siddhi is only attained by devotees.\n\u003e \n\u003e  S치dhan치, Discourses on Tantra Volume Two\n\nIn this state all worldly life comes to an end  one뗩 life becomes a Mission to deliver justice, equality and love to all beings by fighting against all odds.\n\n\u003e The fourth and last stage of s치dhan치 is that of vashiik치ra, when the propensities are all completely directed from the mahattattva towards the one original and ultimate Self (Atman): that is, the s치dhaka [spiritual aspirant] is established in his svabh치va [nature] and svar칰pa [own form]. As the very word vashiik치ra implies [vash means 띾ontrol렣, all the propensities are completely under control. Worldly friends and relatives have already deserted the s치dhaka as they desert a dead body after cremation or burial, and he becomes merged in the permanent and lasting Self, Brahma (Consciousness).\n\u003e \n\u003e  Yatam치na, Vyatireka, Ekendriya and Vashiik치ra, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 33\n\nThough this is a state of advanced yogis, its bliss can be savoured also by novice disciples. For this purpose Baba created P치i攷귺ajanya  collective meditation as 5 AM every morning.\n\n\u003e The fourth stage is when Parama Puru콑a alone is your goal and you attain oneness with Him. Its spirit is, 랑ith the bliss I enjoy after attaining oneness with Parama Puru콑a, or with the bliss I am giving to Parama Puru콑a, or with whatever emanates from that blissful entity, I shall make my existence meaningful.  \n\u003e I have introduced P치i攷귺ajanya to help you derive bliss from this stage. At the time of doing P치i攷귺ajanya the mind becomes filled with spontaneous joy. And no external object is required  just one뗩 inner self. This self sufficiency which every human being can realize through P치i攷귺ajanya, brings success and a new spirit of fulfilment to human life. One뗩 life will shine with the divine effulgence of Parama Puru콑a.  \n\u003e Let your advent in this world be successful in all ways. I want your existence to shine, to be resplendent with the joy of being alive. This is the reason why I introduced P치i攷귺ajanya and Sad치vrata  to bring supreme fulfilment to your lives. Let your advent on this earth be successful, individually and collectively.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Vashiik치ra  2, Ananda Marga Philosophy in a Nutshell Part 6\n\nThis leads of omniscience. However even at this stage downfall is still possible. This is what total surrender is most crucial for a deva.\n\n\u003e Next comes the fourth and final stage, the stage of vashiik치ra. In this stage all the psychic vrttis are brought well within the control of the spiritual practitioner. Suppose someone wants to know what happened 20,000 years ago. The moment the desire to know arises, his or her mind will return to the distant past and will see what really happened 20,000 years ago. If someone wants to know what is written on a particular page of a particular book printed in a certain country he or she sends the mind to that page and comes to know the contents immediately. These are all signs of absolute vashiik치ra siddhi. Ordinary people think that Mr so-and-so is a very well read person but the fact is otherwise. Everything has come from his vashiik치ra siddhi. He can project his mind anywhere to know anything. At that stage everything comes within his perfect control and he attains a kind of godhood. If he fails to surrender himself to Parama Puru콑a, however, what will happen? Well, after attaining vashiik치ra siddhi and acquiring various occult powers, he will develop some ego. He will curse those he hates and thus, unknowingly, will gradually degenerate. He will meet his downfall. So after attaining vashiik치ra siddhi, one should surrender one뗩 unit soul (atman), endowed with the acquired occult powers, to Param치tm치. What will be the result? One will become one with Parama Puru콑a, one will become Parama Puru콑a.\n\u003e \n\u003e  The Four Stages of Human Progress\n\nThe psychological transformation behind the evolution of the deva is explained as follows.\n\n\u003e The fourth stage is known as vashiik치ra. There one is established in the ideation of Parama Puru콑a, to satisfy whom one is doing kiirtana. Here one completely surrenders himself or herself before Parama Puru콑a, and he or she is under the complete control of Parama Puru콑a.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Bio-Psycho-Spiritual System of Kiirtana, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 30\n\n#### Kao콑ikii Shakti\n\nAs we have seen during the Cosmic Cycle of Creation, different forms of Shakti emerge. The shakti where one attains the Cosmic Nucleus, the Supreme Subjectivity or Param치tm치 is known as Shiv치nii Shakti or Kao콑ikii Shakti. It evolves as follows:\n\n\u003e In that triangle of forces, the Operative Principle is called Prakrti and not M치y치, because in that stage She was not able to create anything concrete. The Operative Principle in the triangle of forces is called Kao콑ikii Shakti or Shiv치nii Shakti, and Its witnessing counterpart, the Cognition, is called Shiva.\n\u003e \n\u003e  The Supreme Cognition, Subh치콑ita Sa拷쯚raha Part 24\n\nIn actual fact, Kao콑ikii Shakti is the first movement towards creation. As Shrii Sarkar explains,\n\n\u003e In the cognition of the state of perfect equilibrium of gu켻as, it remains as the Cognitive Being. When it becomes manifest and expresses itself through rhythmic projection as an ideational entity, then we can call it the first emanation of the creative purpose (sa拷쯞alpa). This marks the state of Kao콑ikii Shakti.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Discourse 22, Shabda Cayanik치 Part 4\n\nIt must not be forgotten while one controls and sublimates these shaktis that the goal is always the Cosmic Nucleus and not any shakti. Absorption in this Goal enables one to become free from the bondages of these Shakti as one starts of merge with that Supreme Subjectivity\n\n\u003e At the first stage, when there is no imbalance in the triangle of forces, Prakrti is called Kao콑ikii Shakti (Shiv치nii Shakti). She is given this name because she is responsible for the creation of the ko콑as [layers of mind]. In that supreme stage Kao콑ikii remains unmanifested, remains as the primordial cause of all subsequent manifestations  \n\u003e In intuitional practice this process is reversed: devotees elevate themselves from Bhav치nii Shakti to Bhaeravii Shakti, from Bhaeravii Shakti to Kao콑ikii Shakti, and finally attain oneness with the Supreme Entity. Those who pursue this path of divine adoration are called devotees. Whom do devotees ideate on? Certainly on Puru콑ottama. Those who accept matter as their object of ideation can never attain Puru콑ottama, but will invariably degenerate towards the staticity of Bhav치nii Shakti. Their entire being will ultimately be converted into inert matter. To ideate on Puru콑ottama means to transform Bhav치nii into Bhaeravii and Bhaeravii into Kao콑ikii, thereby establishing oneness between the devotee and the Lord. In the process of transforming crude waves into subtle waves, devotees become one with their final goal  \n\u003e In the struggle to transform Bhaeravii Shakti into Kao콑ikii Shakti, Citishakti [Cognitive Force] plays a dominant role, because Bhaeravii Shakti is the second stage of Citishakti in the flow of creation  \n\u003e Thus in 치sana shuddhi [purification of the seat of spiritual contemplation], Bhaeravii Shakti is concentrated at a nuclear point, and subsequently transformed into Kao콑ikii Shakti. When that transformation occurs, the unit mind gradually dissolves into the Cosmic Mind. The three principles of Prakrti remain perfectly balanced in Kao콑ikii Shakti, and thus lie unexpressed.  \n\u003e Devotees reach Kao콑ikii Shakti with the help of Bhav치nii and Bhaeravii Shaktis. Hence devotees must be Sh치ktas, always ready to fight against the hostile forces which thwart spiritual progress. They must not encourage timidity or cowardice But one should remember that Kao콑ikii Shakti is not one뗩 final goal. Even after merging one뗩 identity into Kao콑ikii Shakti it can still be the cause of bondage and subsequent rebirth.\n\u003e \n\u003e  The Devotee and the Lord, Discourses on Tantra  1\n\nOne aspect of the Tantric dynamics of the Creative Process, of the created world and of all created beings is pram치 or symmetry and equilibrium. Just as there is a Cosmic Triangle of the principles of Prakrti (Cosmic Creative Principle), so also in every sphere of material, metaphysical and spiritual life there is ultimately a triangle of forces. Bringing balance, harmony and sublimation to these triangles is brought about by the control of the 3 shaktis.\n\n\u003e In the last stage of this movement, that is, in the spiritual sphere, one comes in contact with the kao콑ikii shakti, the primordial force of creation. And through the lokatriko켻a [Triangle of Creative Forces] which was established through pram치 siddhi [spiritual equipoise and harmony], which has pram치 sa拷쯨rddhi [complete balance and harmony in one뗩 physical life and in the world] as one side, pram치 rddhi [psychic equilibrium and harmony that is the essence of morality] as another side and pram치 siddhi as the third side  one approaches the vertex of the gu켻atriko켻a. This is the particular vertex of the unbalanced triangle, from which the kao콑ikii shakti came out moving in a straight linear order, not in a systaltic way.  \n\u003e Now in this final stage of spiritual practice, the kao콑ikii shakti will move in a straight line in the opposite direction, along the upward movement of kulaku켻d패alinii, and finally one will become one with the gu켻atriko켻a. This is the state of perfect consummation of human existence; this is the glory of supreme spiritual attainment. You are the spiritual aspirants, it is your duty to establish a balanced triangle through pram치 sa拷쯨rddhi in the physical sphere, pram치 rddhi in the psychic sphere, and pram치 siddhi in the spiritual sphere. By this, your coming to this earth will be successful.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Physical Propulsion, Psychic Propensities and Spiritual Attainment, Subh치콑ita Sa拷쯚raha Part 18\n\n#### 6th Lesson\n\nThe Lesson of Ananda Marga Sahaja Yoga associated with the state of a divine being is that of Dhy치na or the 6th Lesson. In this state one becomes absorbed in the divine flows and love emanating from the Supremely Beloved (Parame콑t패in) Guru. It is thus that one뗩 very existence becomes suffused and dissolved into divine Consciousness. One then uses this blissful state to give more and more love to that dearly Beloved Guru.\n\n**Sixth Lesson: An Introduction**\n\nDhyana is the ultimate lesson of Ananda Marga Sahaja Yoga. Many times Baba would quote a shloka (verse) from the Kul치r켻ava Tantra stating that the state of Sahaja (or Brahma Sadbh치va) is the highest state and that dhyana is the process leading to this state. Sahaja comes from the words Saha meaning 랑ith + 랅a meaning 랎hat which is born. So 랍ahaja refers to something that is 란asily or naturally attained. So this Sahaja Yoga is not an artificial mental process to get control over one뗩 mind and body, nor is it a series of positive moral sentiments. Sahaja Yoga is that process by which one뗩 attains the ultimate state of existence that is our most natural state. The Supreme Consciousness in the core of our being is our natural state, it is who we really are. The yoga or path of union with that natural state is Sahaja Yoga.\n\n\u003e The First Lesson of Ananda Marga meditation takes us to our Goal, our Beloved [Ishta] by harmonizing our meditation with the nature of our mind and the nature of our mantra. The Sixth Lesson of Dhyana, like the First Lesson starts with a process of withdrawal (Pranidhana) but here the meditation is harmonizing with the flows of our Ishta and of His physical Form revealed in the Guru Cakra. Baba has explained how Dhyana leads to the Sahaja stance saying,When the mind moves towards Param치tm치, that is dhy치na. Dhy치na is madhyam치 [middling; second best] because there is duality between the s치dhaka and the object of his or her worship. And the supreme state, the uttam치vasth치, is that where the s치dhaka [worshiper] and the object of worship are one  where the worshipper, the worshipped and the worship unify themselves into one. Therefore, sahaj치vasth치 is supreme  it is uttam치. This is the saying of Shiva. Kabir has also said, S치dhu sahaja sam치dhi bhalii [The seeker attained sahaja sam치dhi렣. Sahaja is derived from the prefix saha plus the root jan plus the suffix d패a. Ja means 랎hat which is born. With what is it born?  \n\u003e Jiiv치tm치 [unit consciousness] and Param치tm치 [Supreme Consciousness] are born together. They are together, but jiivas simply do not look to Him. People think that Param치tm치 is without, so they are not able to attain Him. When they look within, there is oneness. This alone is Sahaj치vasth치.\n\u003e \n\u003e  The Dialogues of Shiva and P치rvatii  3\n\nFrom this quote, we can realize that Sahaja is a state of union and Dhyana therefore is a process of deepening one뗩 union with the Beloved. The word Dhii means a benevolent and pure intellect. Purity arises when that intellect is increasingly less polluted by various mental propensities (vrttis). This state of true wisdom arises when one뗩 mental energy is diverted away from limited expressions like propensities, sentiments and towards the Ishta or Beloved Goal. This process is called Pranidhana and it is part of both First Lesson and Sixth Lesson. The difference is that First Lesson involves Pranidhana focused on different stages of more and more intense detachment from various crude states and the Sixth Lesson involves more and more intense attachment towards assimilating various mystical subtle ecstasies (bh치vas) emanating from the Divine Form of the Ishta. The state whereby one뗩 intellect or Dhii attains ultimate purity by always being absorbed in the thought and ideation of the Ishta is called Dhruva Smrti or 랁irm, constant remembrance. This leads to Dharma-megha-ananda Samadhi. Megha means 띾loud, Dharma means 랍ublime righteousness and Ananda means 랄nfinite happiness or bliss. Those who experience this bliss who are selfless, who are devotees develop intense righteousness. This righteousness is strongly felt by others around them like a storm-cloud.\n\n#### Dhyeya\n\nThe word Dhyana comes from the word 띿hyae which means 랎o think of, imagine, contemplate , meditate on , call to mind , recollect, to be thoughtful or meditative to hold an image in the consciousness continuously without allowing any other image to come, mature reflection, deliberation, absorption.렢n\nNow what is the difference between contemplating upon a human being and Dhyana? To answer this we have to understand who is the Goal of our dhyana, namely our Dhyeya?\n\nThe first type of Dhyeya is an Iishvarakoti or a person who has achieved great realization in their spiritual practices and has developed the capacity to guide others as a lower (anya) guru (preceptor). Such preceptors will ask disciples to not to be diverted by their physical Form but to go within it towards the Supreme Consciousness deep within. For example Ramakrsna Paramhamsa said that he was an Ishvarakoti.\n\nThe second and much more rarer category of Dhyeya is a Brahmakoti or a person who has reached complete union with the Macrocosm (Saguna Brahma). Such preceptors are called Sadgurus because they can give liberation from the cycle of birth and death by merger with Saguna Brahma. Such preceptors can bless disciples in Dhyana by the Darshan of their physical Form but encourage disciples to go beyond this towards Paramatma Dhyana. Paramatma is the Macrocosmic Nucleus or the Supreme Soul residing in the core of our Soul. In Paramatma Dhyana one begins by realizing a blissful, formless effulgence that fills everything and dissolves everything into it. Permament establishment in this state leads to the realization of cid-akasha or the Sky of Consciousness. This is the highest state for yogis.\n\nThe third and incomparably more precious category of Dheya is a Mahasambhuti or a manifestation of Taraka Brahma. Taraka Brahma means Consciousness (Brahma) in the role of the Supreme Liberator (Taraka) who bestows salvation (moksa) or merger in Nirguna Brahma (the Unqualified, Pure Stance of Consciousness). Such preceptors are called Parame콑t패in Gurus or Supreme-Ishta [Beloved] Gurus. These Adi Gurus are the ultimate source of Grace of any lower guru. Disciples can only attain salvation by dhyana on Mahasambhuti after first merging with their personal guru and the guru of their spiritual lineage or dynasty [para拷쯣ar치]. On this small planet, the three Mahasambhutis who have visited here are Lord Shiva, Lord Krsna and Lord Anandamurti. In the subtler realms of the Cosmic Mind, of the collective mind their physical Form is still present. As Baba says about Lord Shiva, In the causal world His sweet smiling form is being transformed according to His wish and radiating divine effulgence throughout the universe. (Vashiik치ra  1)\n\nThe physical Form of Mahasambhuti is an expression of Taraka Brahma. Each part of this Form  radioactive with shakti (divine energy), rapturous beauty and omnipotent love  is an infinite treasure of wondrous, ecstatic expressions. To see this Form in one뗩 life is the ultimate blessing. Paramatma is, as Baba says in Idea \u0026 Ideology, the ultimate state of Saguna Brahma. Hence Paramatma dhyana is far inferior to direct dhyana on the physical form of Mahasambhuti. So Dhyana on the physical Form of Mahasambhuti is the starting point for serious devotees.\n\nNow when we concentrate on an ordinary human being intensely, it becomes an obsession which narrows the mind and degrades us into crudity and causes us to lose the capacity of our higher levels of mind and to project our mental propensities onto them. Ultimately the mind revolts again and again against such concentration on finite beings. However, when we concentrate on a saint what we find is that the infinite, Supreme Consciousness that they have experienced in their meditation overflows onto us causing the stirring within us of Supreme Consciousness buried in the depths of our I-feeling. With the case of a Sadguru it is found that concentration on his/her form leads us towards union with the Macrocosm or Saguna Brahma within them.\n\nHowever, when it comes to Dhyana on the Mahasambhuti of Taraka Brahma we come into the realm of liila or the blissful divine play. Each and every action (liila) of Mahasambhuti  tiny or grand  is radiant with infinite and unique form of bliss. To meditate on one or more of these liilas of His as Mahasambhuti in the past on this planet, to meditate on His new liilas taking place now in the causal world  the endless forms of bliss generated by this takes us to the ultimate stance of Consciousness. Furthermore this blissful union allows Him to use our bodies to share this bliss with others and to be the vehicle for His Mission to liberate human society from all forms of exploitation, violence and religious dogmas. This union of the Dhyeya, the dhy치t치 [disciple] and the dhyana [specific practice one learns in initiation] is the real Sahaja or all-natural state of being alive as a genuine human being on this earth. The great Shaeva Tantric scripture of Kashmir, the Spanda Karikas states,\n\n_Ayamevodayastasya dhyeyasya dhy치yicetasi  \nTad치tmat치sam치pattiricchatah s치dhakasya y치._(II.6)  \n[This alone indeed, is the arising of the Dhyeya in the mind of the disciple (doing dhyana)  namely the sadhaka뗩 (spiritual aspirant뗩) realization (and dissolution) of identity within That (Dhyeya) by the force of divine will (icch치).]\n\nNeedless to say, this divine will power or conation arises only in the mind of someone with tremendous love. This will power is associated especially with Shambhuliunga (the seed point of the Triangle of Creation; the Basic Principle) which is found in the Guru Cakra where one does Dhyana on the Guru.\n\n#### Preparation\n\nAll the earlier lessons are preparation for Dhyana just as Dhyana itself is preparation for divine love where one becomes part of the divine play (liilas). The main purpose of these lessons is to merge the energies of one뗩 sensory and motor organs with one뗩 ectoplasm (citta) or basic substance of the mind. This citta has five layers and one needs to introvert energies to higher and higher levels until one merges in the highest layer (Kosha) that is called the Hiranmaya Kosa [subtle causal mind]. This golden realm is rarely developed in the individual mind and it is developed by Dhyana and this development enables one to develop the power of divine will arising from ardent love for the Beloved (Dhyeya). Baba explains this saying,\n\n\u003e The subtle causal mind is the last (fifth) gateway of perfection. It is the third stage of the superconscious mind. One who experiences this stage of mind reaches very near the Infinite Self within, and such a person뗩 desire for supreme union becomes unbearable. Such a person has an intense desire for God. In this stage of mind there is a complete reflection of Supreme Consciousness. When the spiritual aspirant reaches this stage of mind, his or her mind becomes one with that subtle causal mind, and as a result his or her mind becomes one with the Supreme [or Cosmic] Mind and becomes an all-knowing mind. Then the person becomes an all-knowing personality and attains complete spiritual awareness. The person experiences a divine current of the supreme happiness. He or she attains the fullest expression of humanity: divinity. This is the aim of life. One can reach this stage of mind through dhy치na.\n\u003e \n\u003e  The Superconscious Mind\n\nThere are many other practices which prepare one for Dhyana. Pranayama Baba said is very important as deep concentration that enables contemplation (dhyana) arises when the breath is calm or in a state of pause. Baba has said that someone who has Pranayama Siddhi (ability to perform pranayama without using one뗩 fingers to open and close the nostrils) will readily become established in Dhyana.\n\nAnother important aid is three principles that are the heart of First Lesson  Shravana, Manana and Nididhyasana. Shravana is the spiritual practice of constantly hearing and singing the Divine Name. Manana is the practice of constantly meditating on the Supreme Consciousness alone as in First Lesson. Nididhyasana means taking all mental propensities that are introverted and sublimated by shravana and manana and surrendering that entire psychic energy and one뗩 self unto Supreme Consciousness. This is done through Guru Puja at the end of meditation. It must never be forgotten that Baba said that all lessons of Sadhana, including Dhyana are simply aids to prepare oneself to surrender one뗩 body, mind and Atman unto Baba who is waiting for our surrender during each line we recite of Guru Puja. Thus Dhyana itself is a form of ultimate sacrifice of true surrender to the heart of the Parame콑t패in Guru. This is why the Kul치r켻ava Tantra defines Dhyana saying,\n\n_Y치vadindriyasant치pa拷 manas치 sa拷쯡iyamya ca  \nSv치nten치bhii콑t패adevasya cintana拷 dhy치namucyate._(XVII.36)  \n[Completely controlling, introverting and sublimating the burning pains and miseries of {life dominated by} the indriyas (sensory and motor organs) and the contemplation of the divinity of the inner being of one뗩 I콑t패a (Beloved Goal) is called Dhyana.]\n\nAnd to marvel at the mystery of the inner reality of the Lord, to become intoxicated with this reality in His ecstatic expressions (bh치vas), to dedicate oneself to serving Him and giving Him bliss  this is the true existence (sadbh치va), the only existence worthy of human dignity as children of immortality. Only when human beings run to Him, attracted by His divine Grace, enchanted by His sweetness and benevolence, will they attain real immortality.\n\n#### In a Nutshell\n\nImmortality lies alone in attaining Nirguna Brahma or the Pure, Unqualified Consciousness. This is why the Mu켻d패aka Upa켻ishad states,\n\n_Na chakshush치 grhyate n치pi v치ch치  \nN치nyaerdevaestapas치 karma켻a v치 |  \nji攷치napras치dena vishuddhasattvastatastu  \nTa拷 pashyate nishkala拷 dhy치yam치nah_(III.1.8)  \n[Not by the eye is That [Absolute] apprehended, not by speech or other divine power, nor by penance (tapas), nor by noble service work. The enlightenment (jinana) that comes from the Divine Grace (pras치da), the sentient spirit that comes when one is completely pure and Dhyana enable one to behold That Niskala  Unamanifested, Seedless, Objectless Consciousness.]\n\nThis Niskala is not to be realized by reading the Upanishads or by intellectual analysis. This Niskala is realized in the internal realm of the cakras [centres of subtle vital and spiritual energies.] As Baba says,\n\n\u003e Now this Guru Cakra or Guru Entity or form of Guru is also Him, that is, that Supreme Entity, and He is attracting everything in this universe towards Himself with unparalleled affection from one controlling point. The space measured by ten fingers lying between 치ji攷치 and sahasr치ra cakras also belongs to him. This ten-fingered space is the abode of Ni콑kala Brahma or pure Brahma. So the spiritual aspirant will have to gradually rise up from the bottom to the top, through m칰l치dh치ra [base of spine], sv치dhi콑t패h치na [opposite root of penis], ma켻ipura [navel], an치hata [centre of chest], vishuddha [throat], 치ji攷치 [between the eyebrows], and there, after bathing in the confluence of three rivers [in 치ji攷치 cakra] and being vibrated by the grace of Parama Puru콑a [Supreme Consciousness], they will gradually rise upwards to the highest point of the ten-fingered abode of Parama Puru콑a and arriving there they merge into and become one with Him, this being the highest stage of sadhana. This is nirgu켻a nirvikalpa sam치dhi [non-attributional supreme spiritual stance].\n\u003e \n\u003e  Vasu and V치sudeva\n\nThis is why Baba has quoted the Krama Tantra of Kashmir as saying that by Dhyana one can obtain everything without any other spiritual practice or lesson. Baba has said that if one does extra dhyana one will lose touch with the external world but if one does both Dhyana and 1st lesson then one will maintain balance. So, when human beings surrender all their concentrated mental power into the cosmic infinitude within the inner being of the I콑t패a [ideational Desideratum] one becomes free from microcosmic bondages, that is also a kind of penance (tapas) and is called 띿hy치na yoga. Why is Dhyana a form of suffering or penance according to Baba? Because the goal of a devotee in doing dhyana is not get the power, blessings and love of the Beloved, but to sacrifice oneself for Him. This starts with service to society. In a discourse on Brahma Sadbh치va which is the ultimate goal of Dhyana, Baba explained this saying,\n\n\u003e All the urges and longings should be gathered together and directed towards the Supreme. If this is done indomitable psychic energy and invincible spiritual energy will grow from within. This will enable people to solve all the world뗩 problems  economic, social cultural, big and small. Unless one develops oneself in this way, as an ideal human being, one will not be able to solve any problem, no matter how madly one beats one뗩 chest or how loudly one shouts slogans. The solution should be commensurate with the problem just as the prescription should be commensurate with the disease. The present world is plagued with numerous problems. To solve these problems we need ideal men and women who are highly evolved from within; strong men and women whose lives are based on the solid foundation of spirituality. In the absence of such people the problems will remain unsolved. That is why I say, concentrate all your love and devotion, consolidate all your psychic propensities and channelize them towards the Supreme One. Don뗪 allow them to flow towards any other direction, towards any other object.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Ideation on Brahma\n\nThis unbroken flow of the mind-stuff (citta) in one continuous stream, like the flow of oil, where all the propensities of the mind are fixed on the goal is called Dhyana. When we concentrate on an external object the flow of our mind in always broken even though we may not be aware of it. This is because the mind by nature resisting losing itself in something external. Hence the flow of the mind when concentrating on something external is like a movie in which a series of pictures are played so fast that we think that it is in continuous motion. Dhyana is not an artificial flow like this and that is why Dhyana gives great joy  because it is so natural (Sahaja). The process of dhy치na is so continuous that all capacity of action is exhausted in maintaining this continuity, and the resultant therefore is inaction. When there is a cessation of action, the mind ceases to exist, and that is called sam치dhi. Sam치dhi is also called karma sam치dhi  the actionless state when all karma ceases. This samadhi does not last due to unexpressed samskaras in one뗩 mind and due to failure to observe perfect moral conduct by fighting injustice and inner vices and due to failure to surrender one뗩 mind to the Ideology so as to be able to indulge in selfish states of mind.\n\nAs part of Dhyana one must maintain adjustment with one뗩 glands and sub-glands and this is done by the early stages of withdrawal or Pranidhana. Dhyana is directly concerned with bh치va. When the devotee gets actual experience of the Beloved Baba in meditation or in daily life this is what is bh치va or Idea from the microcosmic point of view. Here the mind is harmonizing, flowing together with that of Supreme Consciousness deep within our I-feeling. Baba notes that there are three types of bh치vas or Ideas. They are (1) intellectual-cum-intuitional; (2) actional; and (3) devotional-cum-emotional.  \nDhyana based on the intellect뗩 pursuit of knowledge ultimately leads to realization of Nirvikalpa Samadhi [merger in the Macrcosmic Nucleus or Paramatma] if the knowledge is desired to educate and enlighten others about the ideology of the Lord and if devotee surrenders everything  including all one뗩 knowledge. However such yogis are useless when it comes to giving love to the Lord. Their dhyana is essentially parasitical.\n\nDhyana based on the determination (samkalpa) to do certain works in this world will ultimately lead to Nirvikalpa Samadhi, if the work is part of the Mission of the Lord and if the devotee surrenders everything. These devotees with great zeal to work endlessly for the Lord are blessed with Him with devotion in a future life.\n\nDhyana based on the emotional outpouring from the devotee to the Lord will ultimately lead to Nirvikalpa Samadhi, if one is NOT selfishly expressing all that is in one뗩 own heart and trying to get His love. Only if one is trying to give more and more bliss to His heart by surrender can one get moksa or salvation. These devotees are the true practicioners of Dhyana. Many devotees practice dhyana as per their samskaras or mental tendencies arising from the stored reactions to their past deeds. Thus one will do Dhyana on Baba as His servant or PA, or as His child, or as His friend, or as His premii (divine lover). A true devotee like Sant Jinaneshvar will say that I will not have any relationship with You. Such devotees will not want that their Dhyana and their relationship be guided by their samskaras. True devotees will realize that just as Baba is everything to us  father, mother, brother, sister, friend, wife, husband, lover, son, daughter and servant  so we must be everything for Him  \nUltimately the only thing that is important is love and love means Baba getting bliss. Whether we get bliss is irrelevant. Our dhyana becomes feeble when our love is feeble. Then we have great difficulty in maintaining concentration as the mind runs away to trivial pursuits. This is why Baba said that the best way to catch the mind is to think about the physical service of the I콑t패a in dhy치na. This means doing detailed, long service to Him in Dhyana as His PA, as His mother, etc. This will cause our love to increase. Baba explains this saying,\n\nDhy치na is withdrawing the mental propensities from all extroversive entities, and then collecting those withdrawn mental forces, mental propensities, and urging them towards the Supreme Entity. If there is no love for the Supreme Entity, this movement cannot be done. Where there is no love, the mind will not run after Him. So dhy치na also becomes meaningless.\n\n\u003e Dhy치na comes from the root verb 띿hyae, which means to withdraw the mental propensities and to goad them towards Him. So, if people practice all these things without having love for the Supreme, they won뗪 be able to get anything. But, if there is an iota of love, if there is a wee bit of love, they gain everything. Only those intelligent people who know this  even if if they are not efficient or proficient in the sphere of dharma; even if they are not efficient in doing japa kriy치 [mantra incantation]; even if they know nothing regarding yoga; even if they know nothing regarding celestial and extra-celestial knowledge; even if they do not understand Guru Bhakti [devotion to Guru]; even if they do not understand the inner spirit of japa; even if they do not know ji攷치na [knowledge]  can get everything if the spirit behind this idea of loving the Supreme is just in a rudimental phase. In a later phase it becomes, I love Him not to get anything; I love Him because I get pleasure in loving Him  and for no other purpose. And in the final stage the devotee feels that, I love Him, not to get any pleasure for myself. I love Him, because I want my love to give Him pleasure. That is purely unilateral, not reciprocal. Where there is the idea of reciprocity, it is not devotion, it is an ordinary commercial transaction  give some money, get some article.렢n\u003e \n\u003e  Who is Gopa\n\nThis ultimate stage of devotion is the essence of true Dhyana. Baba has given one definition of dhyana as sarvaras치sv치dana in a footnote in the book Yoga Sadhana. Sarva means 라ll rasa means 랁low, nectar and sv치da means 랎o taste. So to taste all the divine, nectarean flows coming from every expression of Baba뗩 physical Form in Dhyana, from his subtle moods or bh치vas, from His endless Forms of effulgence and from His yearning is what Dhyana is all about. However, this is not done in the selfish way of enjoyment of crude devotees. One enjoys because our enjoyment gives Him delight. When we are thrilled with one of the countless beautiful ways in which Baba is adorned with various clothes or colours, we are especially thrilled because we feel Baba뗩 delight in our thrill. The sign of a true premii (divine lover) is to bring out the Beauty in the Beloved by the simplest action like a gaze because there is utmost surrender and burning yearning to set His heart on fire. In reality, rasa also means relish. Every object of the entire physical, psychic and spiritual realms is created out of His delight or blissful relishing at being able to express His love. So in reality whatever we relish in this world is already relished by Him. Devotees share even their enjoyment of His love with Him. When they eat, they share the nice taste of the food with Him. When they do service, they share the joy of helping others with Him. When they study and enlighten others about His ideology, they share this joy with Him. Caitanya Mahaprabhu was such a selfless devotee that he even shared the bliss of Radha Bhava with Krsna. This is what made him the only Neohumanist in the history of this planet.\n\nAnd when we see such devotees we realize how Baba뗩 categories of bhakti apply to Dhyana.\n\n1) Tamasika Dhyana is Dhyana where one is goaded by the desire to defeat, harm or kill someone else. To pollute one뗩 dhyana by talking to Baba about one뗩 personal enemies is a crime. To use Baba in dhyana to vent all one뗩 negative feelings about people in this way  this is the action of criminal devotees.  \n2) Rajasika Dhyana is the most common type of Dhyana. Here one is goaded by various material desires to have a good job or posting, to get money, to get success in exams, promotion, to get more intellectual knowledge and be a great intellectual, to want for peope to respect and serve us, etc and to get relief from one뗩 problems of daily life. This type of Dhyana is most hypocritical. Such disciples will say, I am not thinking about that job. I have left everything up to You. You do what You like. But internally there are expectations, hopes that the Lord will give them the job. Such people are nothing but devotional parasites. Such people are reborn as luminous bodies for thousands of years.  \n3) Sattvika Dhyana is common amongst yogis. Here one desires spiritual bliss, bhavas, samadhis, to become a famous saint/guru, to have spiritual knowledge, to get moksa so as to escape from suffering in the world. Many of these people say they want to enjoy tasting sugar and not become sugar. They are a more subtle form of devotional parasite. So long as such devotees remain humble and serve others, they will be blessed by the Lord with purer devotion in future lives where they will be able to do genuine Dhyana for the first time.\n\nAll these 3 types of dhyana are forms of Narcissism which is nothing but malignant self-love. Such devotees will do Dhyana and even merge with Baba to give bliss to themselves. For example, they will enjoy massaging Baba in Dhyana and at the same time be merged with Baba and receive their own massage. Thus they will exploit Baba뗩 bliss in Dhyana to get bliss by massaging themselves. This is Dhyana based on Atma-sukha Tattva (Principle of Selfish Pleasure). This self-centred psychology is also the root of capitalist greed and violence. It is also the cause for the downfall of the disciples. This is why Baba warned us,\n\n\u003e You are plundering His mercy in everything day and night. Go on working as a machine, leaving the doership to Him. How little can your poor intellect comprehend or analyse His unfathomable sport (liil치)! So, instead of trying to comprehend or analyse keep the bearing of that inscrutable Juggler aglow before your eyes  \n\u003e So I repeat, do not try to analyse that Supreme Entity with the pride of your petty intellect. Do the S치dhan치 of attaining Him with the ardent devotion of your heart and all your discrepancies and limitations will end. Remember, where 랓ou is He is not and where He is, small 랓ou is not. He is your final destination.\n\u003e \n\u003e  The Primordial Cause of Creation\n\n#### Types of Dhyana\n\nThis ultimate existence arises when the disciple attains the realm beyond the Hiranmaya Kosa [subtle causal mind] called Satyaloka. This is the realm of the Satyaloka. This is the realm of the purest existential feeling [Knower-I] in the form of the awareness I exist that is free from almost all forms of duality. This layer of the mind is called the Mahat or the Vastness of Cosmic Consciousness. The process of purifying the Mahat accelerates when all the Lessons are practiced regularly as part of one뗩 Dhyana. This allows one to be blessed with the divine touch of the Beloved. Baba said in Timmern, Germany, that 랎here cannot be any peace, any happiness or any beatitude till the aspirant comes in tactual contact [touch] with the Supreme Self. When this tactual contact becomes intense and one feels it overwhelmingly in every part of one뗩 being, then there arises the bliss of the devotional stance of Mahabhava as Baba revealed in His discourse. Yet this bliss transcending all lessons comes only by purifying the Mahat. As Baba explains,\n\n\u003e The more one뗩 mental mirror is clear, the more it is free from impurities, and the more brilliantly and fully it receives this spiritual radiance. Those unit beings who purify their existential I (Mahat) through intuitional practice, enjoy the sweet bliss of His touch. If Mahatattva is impure, His reflection is not properly received. Thus those sadhakas [spiritual aspirants] whose minds are crude and inert are not able to apprehend even a iota of His sweet essence. That is why at the time of happiness their illusion-dulled mental waves seek to remain in smug oblivion, disregarding Him; and at the time of sorrow they unduly find fault with Him, failing to understand His merciful dispensation that exists behind that sorrow. Just as in a dirt-free or less dirty mirror you can see an original object very well and in the event of more dirt, the knowledge of object becomes hazier, exactly so is the case with self-visualization of 츼tman in the mental mirror.\n\u003e \n\u003e  This World and the Next\n\nAnd the Beloved shines in each mental mirror in countless, unique ways. This is why, there are as many types of Dhyana as there are disciples. Among the types discussed by Baba is Bh치v치tmaka Dhyana. In this state the disciple becomes lost in the fathomless greatness of the Lord. Beginner disciples say, In each and every way You have revealed Yourself, I have lost myself. Through each of the countless gestures, movements, dances of every part of the physical Form of Mahasambhuti  ecstatic moods (Bh치vas) are being radiated. In addition there are so many more expressions of love on the psychic level in the way in which He creates so many dramas of ultimate intense intimacy through countless divine dramas (liilas). From these also so many Bh치vas are radiating. So in this type of dhayana one is becoming lost in these expressions. This is not an ideal form of Dhyana because here one is losing oneself in the bliss of His Bh치vas rather than giving Him Bliss that send Him into more sweeter Bh치vas.\n\nThen there is Ras치nandayoga Dhyana. In this Dhyana, one feels surrounded by Him on all sides and feels His touch. One뗩 entire mind and body is vibrated with the touch of the Supreme. This is a type of Dhyana attained by a devotee who love the Lord as a divine lover (premii). One is blessed with this state by selfless service, selfless fight against injustice and selfless, continuous love  but ultimately it is all the Grace of the Beloved Baba. Baba said that to begin to understand His Grace, one has to do Dhyana. Baba has explained the bliss of His Touch in Mah치bh치va in these words,\n\n\u003e When the s치dhaka [spiritual aspirant] feels the closest proximity of Parama Puru콑a, even within his embrace, that bh치va is called mah치bh치va At the time of mah치bh치va, the s치dhaka feels the tactual presence of Parama Puru콑a and falls down. At that time, every nerve-cell, every nerve-fibre and every pore of the human body feels the divine touch. The entire [extent] of the conscious, subconscious and unconscious minds becomes filled with devotion.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Dasha, Bh치va and Mah치bh치va\n\nThis type of dhyana is also not ideal. A true devotee lives to give bliss to Baba and not to receive bliss from Him. When one is crying, singing, laughing, dancing with tears streaming, hairs standing on end, swooning  this is not love. This means Baba is loving us. When Baba is crying, singing, laughing, dancing with tears streaming, hairs standing on end, swooning  when one sends Baba into Mahabhava  this is the real love.\n\nAnother type of Dhyana discussed several time by Baba is Anudhyana. Anu means 랁ollowing. So here one is following or trying with determination to attain union with Him deep within. Many times, Baba has quoted a shloka (verse) from the Shvet치shvatara Upanishad, that the way to union with Him is through Abhi-dhyana or complete dhyana, comprising Pranidhana and Anudhyana. This Upanishad is strongly influenced by Shiva Tantra and hence was often quoted by Baba. Anudhyana essentially means to run after the Beloved in the endless chambers of the Guru Cakra [occult plexus at the crown of the head], Sahasrara Cakra [Macropropensitive Plexus above the crown of the head] and beyond. When we run after something or someone then our feelings for them are heightened, then our determination to find and hold them is intensified. Intellectuals say the spiritual path is like a razor뗩 edge but devotees rush forward without bothering about the path because they are in love with their Beloved Lord. This is the actual Dharma as Baba says,\n\n\u003e People must be freed from the spell of scriptural authority and led along the path of rationality. They should be made to understand that to run towards Parama Brahma  the essence of all essences  is the one and only dharma. There is no other dharma for human beings뵝e are running and shall continue to run to take shelter aboard the only dependable ship on the ocean of the physical universe  the Supreme Entity. That Supreme Entity is the only shelter of all (though He Himself has no shelter). We have none but Him, we have no other desideratum.\n\u003e \n\u003e  In Adoration of the Supreme\n\nThere are different ways of starting Dhyana. Some begin by imagining and ideating on Baba뗩 Form as shown in the photo. Others however do not do this but instead simply sit, wait and cry for Him to come. Others run forwards crying out unto Him. Eventually one will have to run after Him. Now when one runs after Him, He will play hide-and-seek. Even when He appears, He will reveal all one뗩 mistakes, defects, hypocrisy and sins. This is a test. Those who have less love will feel pain and will stop running after Him. They will cling to their sinner complex and inferiority complex as a form of negative self-centredness so as to avoid full commitment to surrender.\n\nThose who have more ardent love will say, O Lord, I may be a sinner, I may be a degraded person, but still I am Yours. I am Your child. Whatever I may be, a sinner, a fool, a scoundrel, I will chase You. I will run and run after You. After all, how much can You run? I will surely catch You. I won뗪 spare You. I am a sinner. I am a sinner, but even then I will not spare You, because You are this sinner뗩 Father! Such devotees He is bound to place in His lap.\n\nSometimes it happens that a person running after Him in Anudhy치na ultimately forgets himself or herself. This is known as 치r치dhan치. When devotees feel in their heart of hearts that their existence is meaningless without attaining their Beloved and that they cannot survive a single moment without feeling His blissful presence, then one truly starts to run like mad. One neither looks right, left or straight ahead. One neither thinks or feels anything  one desperately tries to find Him, hold Him and love Him every single moment. This irresistible urge causes one to not just forget oneself but to lose oneself completely.\n\nThis anudhyana does not just take place when one meditates. It also takes place in the collective or social realm. Baba explains this saying,\n\n\u003e This running, this forward movement, is known as 랋roto-psycho-spirituality. What happens through this proto-psycho-spirituality? When a person is guided by it to think in a particular way, and sees that one뗩 own benevolent mode of thinking is not reflected in other people뗩 activities, then that person can easily realize their true nature. So those who practise this proto-psycho-spirituality can easily recognize those demons in human framework. Then, after recognizing them, it is their duty to expose them to others also, to make people understand that they are repeatedly harming human society. It is not enough for one to personally unmask them; one must open the eyes of others also. Only in this way can the well-being of the world be promoted. Thus it will not be sufficient to lie peacefully in wait, like goody-goodies in isolated ivory towers. One will have to spread one뗩 wings and soar high into the blue firmament.\n\u003e \n\u003e  An Ideology for a New Generation\n\nWhile one may attain salvation by this type of Anudhyana or Aradhana it is not ultimately ideal for devotees. True devotees are running after Him to give Him bliss. They do not run to Him because they are charmed and overwhelmed by His sweetness. They run towards Him out of burning yearning to give Him more and more bliss. The sign of this purer Anudhyana or Aradhana is that when one has this, Baba will chase you and will openly give His heart for you and swoon with love for you. Ultimately Baba says that the secret of Dhyana, like all sadhana, is to realize that in fact we are not doing dhyana on Him as the object of our mind. In fact Baba as the soul of our soul does dhyana on us and watches as we try to realize Him and surrender to Him. So for the devotee, it is He truly who runs after us in Para (higher) Anudhyana. It is He who loses Himself in His Aradhana for us. This is the Final Word in Dhyana.\n\n#### Conclusion\n\nDhyana has many marvelous mysteries that cannot be written. The details about the Guru Cakra, about Baba뗩 Mudras, about how Dhyana becomes transformed into actual contact (Darshana) with Baba, etc are to be experienced and not spoken of. Above the treasures of radiant light coming from every part of Baba뗩 Feet is thus far beyond the scope of human language. The beauty of Baba뗩 dress, the special blessings and bliss of meditation on each part of His Form, the countless dramas He creates in just one single moment  all this is waiting to be expressed. The very purpose of Sadvipra Samaja is to create a society where one can spend one뗩 life celebrating these countless types of bliss with Baba and gain the power to drown Him in His own love. It is for this reason alone that we concentrate on His Mudras. To protect us from everything that takes us away from this ultimate Mission of Union and to bestow us with the capacity to be able to love Him as intensely and tenderly as He loves us  it is for this reason that we surrender unto His Mudras in Dhyana. This is the real meaning of Baba뗩 Crucial Command.\n\n\u003e Utilizing the vibrations created for eternal time  \n\u003e by Shrii Shrii 츼nandam칰rtijii through j치nusparsha  \n\u003e and var치bhaya mudr치s, take  \n\u003e yourself and the entire universe  \n\u003e ahead along the path of  \n\u003e all-round welfare.  \n\u003e O攷拷 sh치nti!\n\u003e \n\u003e -Ananda Marga Cary치carya\n\n#### Vishesh Yoga\n\nThis is a special spiritual practice of many lessons that was given only to advanced, hard-working Acaryas (teachers of meditation). This is a sadhana requiring intense concentration power and a lot of free time since the practices take a great deal of time and even burn a great amount of physical energy.\n\nNow, Shrii Sarkar has clearly said that it does not give more devotion than the normal Sahaja Yoga that all disciples practice. Then what is the purpose of this form of sadhana? The answer is that this sadhana gives one tremendous mental power and subtle physical power. This power is solely to be used for the revolutionary work of the Sadvipra. This yoga is a very dangerous yoga. Those who perform this yoga while having conscious or sub-conscious desires will fall from the spiritual path and also cause other people to fall. Those who master this special yoga to do more and more service work and revolutionary work become Purodhas. Let us examine who is a Purodha. The definition of a Purodha is\n\n_Purasi Hita拷 Dh치rayati Ity치rthe Purodhah._\n\n#### Definitions\n\nHita means 락enevolent service. That which leads to one뗩 physical, psychic and spiritual well-being is called hita. There is a word hita whose colloquial meaning is 랂ood, but which actually means the desire for physical, mental and spiritual progress. There are four types of service that lead to hita.\n\n1.  Sh칰drocita sev치 is serving with your physical body, rendering physical service, rendering medical service.\n2.  Then k콑atriyocita [martial service] is security service, helping the weak.\n3.  Then vaeshyocita sev치 [economic service] is relief work, feeding the poor, helping the needy.\n4.  Then viprocita sev치 is preaching morality, teaching, preaching the ideology, doing dharma prac치ra [spiritual propagation]. They are all viprocita sev치 Now, all these four items come within the scope of hita [welfare].\n\nDh치rayati means 띾arries, maintains, holds, undergoes, practices, preserving, sustaining, observing and practicing.  \nIty치rtha means 랃aving this purpose, for this purpose 랃aving this meaning, 랈eans, 랄s called. Artha also means temporary relief from physical, psychic and spiritual (viraha  burning yearning for Him) pain as per Baba.\n\n_Commentary:_  \nSo who is a Real Purodha? A Purodha is someone who is always taking the lead in all spheres of social service. That means people who are taking the lead of doing sudhra service of providing medicine, food, clothing/blankets, housing to refugees from violence, victims of natural disasters, victims of exploitation. That means people taking the lead to doing ksattriya service and protecting lower castes, indigenous people (adivasis), religious minorities, racial minorities from violence and discrimination. That means people who are taking the lead in doing vaeshya service by starting cooperatives and making poor communities economically independent and helping fight for economic freedom (of their community and their samaj) from corporations and the government.\n\nThat means doing Vipra seva which has many dimensions. Firstly it refers to those who are educating the people not just in literacy but by doing jinana vistara (informing the people what their economic, spiritual (of their ancestral spirituality), political, cultural, social rights) and vijinana sadhana (fighting to establish the people in those rights in daily life).\n\nSecondly it refers to those who are training people how to carry out protests and revolution.\n\nThirdly it refers to those who are doing the most important work of creating a cultural renaissance in the local samaja language by creating new grammar based on Baba뗩 [affectionate term for Shrii Sarkar], creating new moral, yogic (incorporating local gods as related to different cakras and different stages of Brahmacakra), devotional (based on His songs), folk culture, novels, plays poems, newspapers, radio stations, etc.\n\nFourthly it refers to those who are creating a meditation revolution  not amongst rich elites stressed out from robbing the rest of the planet  but from young boys (in US, India, etc) in prisons due to poverty, amongst the women who are sold like cattle, amongst the people being robbed and killed by the corporate-government-military elites.\n\nFiftly it refers to those who are creating a devotional revolution like Caitanya Mahaprabhu and like Baba asked us to do when He visited Spain. Baba asked us to do Kiirtan Peace Marches (Kiirtan Shanti Yatras) and Neohumanism pracar to fight religious extremists. For Baba뗩 Final Command was for every margis and every wt in every house to prepare to fight those Snakes who preach religious hate and who practice religious violence in all countries of the world. Sixthly it refers to those who are developing the ideology in all dimensions such as preparing block-level, regional-level and samaja-level economic plans by collective meetings with the local people and experts (cultural, economic, ecological. It also refers to those who are surrendering to Baba and by His Grace expanding and developing the ideology in the realms of PROUT, Brahmacakra, Microvita, Prama, Agriculture and so much more. Seventhly it refers to those are spreading the Stories of the Blissful Liilas of Lord Anandamurti in songs (bhajans), dramas, epics, biographies,etc. in all languages of this planet. Eightly it refers to those who are working through all these ways and more to unite humanity to give more and more love to Baba and create a revolution in His heart.\n\nThose who are showing by their sacrifice, courage (risking their lives) and non-stop work how to serve humanity in all these ways they are the purodhas. Baba said in the article The Criteria of the Guru that the True Guru (Paramestin Guru) will guide humanity in all intellectual and intuitional fields, in all practical physical fields and in all the dimensions of spirituality. So a True Disciple (of the True Guru) or purodha also has to lead the society by risking their lives in fighting injustice, by surrendering their selves so completely that Baba뗩 All-Knowing, All-Powerful, All-Loving shakti flows works and fights to guide humanity through them in ALL these endless ways.  \n\nOne who is holding (dh치ra), who is protecting, nurturing, loving humanity (especially suffering humanity) in all these ways is a Real Purodha. One who is practicing and undergoing suffering (Tapas) in pursuit of this kind of nuclear revolution is a RealPurodha.  \n\nThey alone can be called (ityartha) sadvipras, because the meaning and purpose of their lives is to serve humanity by liberating them (artha) from physical, psychic and spiritual sufferings. In reality there has been only one Real Purodha in the almost 60 year old history of Ananda Marga on this tiny planet.\n\n#### Shaeva\n\nWe have seen that Ananda Marga sadhana is a blending of three types of spirituality  the Sh치kta, and the Vae콑켻ava. The third and culminating form spiritual personality is that of the Shaeva.\n\n\u003e The difference between the unsullied Shaivite Shaeva bh치va and the Vaishnavite nity치nanda is very little. In fact nity치nanda can also be experienced in Nirgu켻a Brahma bh치va [the Shaeva bh치va, here denoted the 랉on-attributional bh치va]. The difference between the Vaishnavite nity치nanda and the Shaivite nirvikalpa sam치dhi [trance of indeterminate absorption] is not more than the difference between the original bh치va of Puru콑ottama and that of Nirgu켻a Brahma. The attainment of the eternal stance at the altar of Nirgu켻a Brahma is Shaev치vasth치 [the highest state of merger with Shiv]. In Ananda Marga there has been a unique blending of the Sh치kta, Shaeva and Vae콑켻ava systems of spiritual practice  \n\u003e When s치dhakas become ensconced in nity치nanda they are said to have attained the Shaeva stage. One who has not been an ideal Vae콑켻ava cannot be an ideal Shaeva. Shaivites have no minds of their own, for they have already surrendered their minds to their dear Lord. This is the supreme surrender, this is the supreme attainment.  \n\u003e Ratn치karastava grha拷 grhi켻ii ca padm치;  \n\u003e Deya拷 kimapi bhavate Puru콑ottam치ya.  \n\u003e 츼bhiirav치manayan치pahrtam치nas치ya;  \n\u003e Datta拷 mana yadupate tvamida拷 grh치켻a.  \n\u003e [Your abode is brimming over with gems and jewels. The goddess of fortune is Your housekeeper. What can I offer to You, O Lord? Oh yes, there is one thing You lack, as it has been stolen by Your devotees; it is Your mind. I therefore offer my mind to You. Please accept it.]\n\u003e \n\u003e  S치dhan치, Discourses on Tantra Volume Two\n\n#### Kaevalya\n\nAs seen earlier, when the kundalinii rises and as the yogi surrenders, at each cakra a unique form of devotional sam치dhi takes place. The final stage in this process and in what we have seen is R치g치tmik치 Bhakti.\n\n\u003e And the last stage is when that kulaku켻d패alinii comes here [crown of the head]. I said that in the unit structure, Shambh칰liu攷귾a, Parama Puru콑a, is here, at the controlling point of the pineal gland. The divinity, the sleeping divinity, is to be exalted to that point, to the controlling point of the pineal gland. And there is the final stage of sam치dhi. That final stage of sam치dhi is called nirvikalpa sam치dhi in yoga, and kaevalya in Tantra. In Sanskrit kaevalya means 딾nly. Kevala means 딾nly, and the noun of kevala is kaevalya.  \n\u003e That is, only one Entity exists. That entity may be I, that entity may be He. But the differentiation between I and He disappears. So I exist and He exists  these two ideas disappear: 딴xists. That is, it is the stage of non-attributional Consciousness. It is the supreme stage of yogic s치dhan치 [spiritual practice]. It is the supreme stance for a yogi.  \n\u003e Now by dint of s치dhan치, one is to arouse and exalt that sleeping divinity. That Svayambh칰liu攷귾a [at the base of the spine] becomes one with Shambh칰liu攷귾a [state of Macropsychic Connation].  \n\u003e But for this one requires divine help. And I know one is sure to get divine help. And I know further that one is getting divine help. And I know still further that in future, for infinite time and infinite space, one will be getting this divine favour. And you are all s치dhakas. You will certainly attain that supreme stance and enjoy that divine blessedness. You are sure to enjoy it, my sons and my daughters.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Stages of Samadhi, Discourses on Tantra 1\n\n#### Acquiring Knowledge\n\nThe blissful form of knowledge that one acquires in this state is described below.\n\n\u003e The last stage is samyaka 치tmasthiikara켻a. When the sky filling cloud of the mind is directed towards Parama Puru콑a it is called dharmamega in scripture. Human beings come in close proximity with Parama Puru콑a through the science of dharmamega. That stage is called samyaka 치tmasthiikara켻a. It is the stage in which s치dhakas form a clear understanding of the physical, psychic, and spiritual realms of life. They thereby come to know of everything of this universe. Their knowledge is lasting, final and absolute. The [yoga] scripture says, rtambhar치 tatra praji攷치, i.e., their knowledge is filled with veracity.  \n\u003e Permanent knowledge is not possible through perception, inference, or authority, or by studying books or discourses. The knowledge which one attains by expanding one뗩 mind in the psychic sphere through the practice of s치dhan치, which I gave the name upa 치tmasthiikara켻a is also not everlasting, although it does last for a certain period. Knowledge only becomes permanent when the human beings withdraw the entire intuitive element and focus it on their spiritual point of ideation. At that time the entire universe comes within the scope of their mind, and they become omniscient.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Ekendriya  2, Ananda Marga Philosophy in a Nutshell Part 6\n\n#### Dagdhabiija\n\nAt this stage all seeds of past karma stored in the mind are burnt. However those who are genuinely divine personalties never seek to escape. Rather they willingly take upon themselves the sins (past karma) of others. Why? It is because this negative karma causes so many people to lack purity of mind and to feel powerless and full of various complexes. When people are freed from their crude karma they can dare to dream to ending the limitless himsa of the capitalists despite the powerful armies under their control. Such a liberating deva is called a Dagdhabiija.\n\n\u003e While doing s치dhan치, a s치dhaka reaches a stage where p칰r켻a bhakti [cent per cent devotion] is aroused for Param치tm치. Then one remains unassailed even if a cyclone of misery attacks him or her. One feels maximum torture in the mind, but he or she little cares for it, taking it to be the benediction of Param치tm치 Himself. Torture is there but he or she derives bliss from it. The s치dhaka of that stage is called dagdhabiija [burnt seed]. A dagdhabiija comes within the range of psychic directly.  \n\u003e Biija means 랍eed. Wherever a seed is sown, it [sprouts into] a plant; but where the seed is burnt, a plant is not produced. A s치dhaka becomes dagdhabiija when he or she has no more pain or pleasure of his or her own. One who has surrendered in toto and has not kept in hand even a single paisa of it, is alone dagdhabiija. All carry their own burdens, but if a dagdhabiija s치dhaka so desires, he or she can carry the burdens of others also. And those who want to carry the burden of others do lessen the burden of Param치tm치 indirectly. You should remember this.  \n\u003e Do not remain worried about your individual problems at all. Be prepared to carry your own burden and be prepared also to carry the burdens of others. Then alone are you brave. Be dagdhabiija. Everyone has his or her own individual problems. Do not try to pass them on to others. On the contrary, bear the burdens of others. No one is your enemy. Be ready to bear the burdens of others.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Dagdhabiija, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 30\n\n#### NeoHumanism\n\nNow in this stage one뗩 bhakti or devotion blossoms in society. As Shrii Sarkar says,\n\n\u003e When this Neohumanism operates in the external sphere, then internal devotion as a principle is transformed into devotion as a mission.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Bondages and Solutions, The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism\n\nThis devotion as mission is explained beautifully by Shrii Sarkar as follows:\n\n\u003e So first there is 랍pirituality as a cult [yoga], secondly, 랍pirituality in essence, and thirdly, 랍pirituality as a mission. All existential phenomena are emanating from the Existential Nucleus. The existential nucleus of a single individual has a direct link with the Cosmological Hub, a direct link with the Existential Nucleus of the Cosmological order. But this path is not psycho-spiritual; according to Neohumanism, the final and supreme goal is to make one뗩 individual existential nucleus coincide with the Cosmic Existential Nucleus (n치dabindu yoga, in the language of Tantra). As a result, the unit being뗩 entire existential order becomes one with the Controlling Nucleus of the existential order of the Supreme Entity of the Cosmological order, and that will be the highest expression of Neohumanism. That Neohumanistic status will save not only the human world but the plant and animal worlds also. In that supreme Neohumanistic status, the universal humanity will attain the consummation of its existence. Then nothing will be impossible for human beings; they will be able to do anything and everything.  \n\u003e Today뗩 humanity is in despair; people think too much about their imperfections. They think, Can I do it? But in that supreme, Neohumanistic status, they will say, Yes, I am a Neohumanistic being and I am destined to do great work. For that purpose I have come onto this earth. So there is no scope for doubt whether I can do it or not.  \n\u003e Once long ago I went to Purulia. I was carrying heavy baggage. I asked a village man: Can you carry this baggage? He replied: Why not, certainly I can! I appreciated his answer very much. And I am sure that one day this Neohumanism will inspire the world population to say, Why not, certainly we can!  \n\u003e And I am confident that on that day no geo-sentiment will be able to rear its head, no socio-sentiment will be able to erect barriers of discrimination in human society, nor will any demon be able to harm millions of people in the name of humanism by exploiting their gullibility. And when those ever-vigilant human beings, those physico-psycho-spiritual entities, will be able to merge their existential nuclei with the Supreme Existential Nucleus, then only will Neohumanism be permanently established, and human beings will be ensconced in the joy of freedom forever. On that day they will proclaim in full-throated voices: We have come to the world to perform great deeds  for the physical welfare of all, for the psychic happiness of all, and for the spiritual elevation of all  to lead all from darkness unto light. If, even then, someone says: No, darkness is good for me! we will tell them: ㄸll right, darkness is good for you, but just once why don뗪 you come and see the light  it is even better!뗖n\u003e \n\u003e  Neohumanism Is the Ultimate Shelter, The Liberation of Intellect: Neohumanism\n\n#### PROUT\n\nThus it is when that becomes a deva that one becomes a full-fledged Sadvipra. Now Shrii Sarkar has said that the Sadvipra is a blending of Lord Shiva뗩 Avadhuta, Lord Krsna뗩 gopi and Lord Krsna뗩 spiritual warrior. Now let us explore these unique forms of spirituality.\n\n#### Shiva Avadhuta\n\nShrii Sarkar quoted a Sanskrit verse which defines the Avadhuta as follows:\n\n\u003e The s치dhaka who views everything with equanimity, be it his home or the burial ground, gold or grass, his own children or his enemies, fire or water, his own property or another뗩 property, lives in the world as an avadh칰ta, as the veritable manifestation of Shiva.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Discourse 24, Nam치mi Kr콑켻asundaram\n\nSuch Avadhuta are Kaolas which are defined thus:\n\n\u003e Kaola means the spiritual aspirant who has raised the coiled serpentine, known as kulaku켻d패alinii in Sanskrit, and brought it to the controlling point of the pineal gland. (To establish the union of the fundamental negativity with the fundamental positivity; of the starting point with the culminating point.) Such aspirants are called kaola because they have raised the kulaku켻d패alinii; the adjective of kula is kaola. Kula is the noun, kaola the adjective. All s치dhakas, each and every s치dhaka, can become a kaola through s치dhan치.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Kaola and Mah치kaola, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 23\n\nThe Kaolas as true devas live out of devotion to the Supreme Lord known as the Mahakaola.\n\n\u003e The point where the jiivabh치va, that is, the sense of the unit identity, is locked, is called kula. Hence those who achieve perfection through s치dhan치 are called kaola뵚hose who can move the collective ectoplasm through the medium of their ectoplasmic rhythm, can awaken new power in shabda [sound expression] through their own ectoplasmic strength. The awakening of this power in shabda is called purashcara켻a in Sanskrit. And those who can perform such a tough task are called Mah치kaola. They alone are worthy of the status of guru and no one else. When a Mah치kaola awakens vibrations in the universal ectoplasmic body through the medium of particular shabdas, those shabdas [are also altered and] acquire the status of siddha mantras [liberating mantras].\n\u003e \n\u003e  Mantra Caetanya, Discourses on Tantra Volume One)\n\n#### Krsna Gopi\n\nThe Gopi is defined by Shrii Sarkar as follows: Gop치yate yah sah gopah. [Those exist solely to give bliss (to the Lord) are known as gopas.] As Shrii Sarkar explains\n\n\u003e Those whose very nature is to give joy to Parama Puru콑a are in gopii bh치va뵚hose who are genuine devotees do not do anything for their own pleasure: they do everything for His satisfaction, and they get much more pleasure by serving Parama Puru콑a than even He gets. You should always remember뵟ou should emulate the example of those devotees who have genuine love for Parama Puru콑a who are ever ready to do everything to give joy to Him. Oh spiritual aspirant, do not desire to be a philosopher, or an intellectual  become a devotee. Be one with Parama Puru콑a, and make your existence meaningful in all respects through constant service and devotion to Him.\n\u003e \n\u003e  What Is the Way?, Subh치콑ita Sa拷쯚raha Part 11\n\nHow do we become gopis? Shrii Sarkar explains it in the following words:\n\n\u003e Those who worship Parama Puru콑a with single-minded devotion, with their undivided attention discarding all other mundane thoughts, and, bringing about a smooth softness in their mental flow, move towards Parama Puru콑a, are called gopiis or devotees. No one can depict these types of devotees, because the inner devotion of their tender ideation is embedded in the deepest recesses of their hearts. It is completely internal, a matter of their psychic world. It is also difficult to give proper expression to the thoughts of these gopiis, who are specially endowed with this unique devotion and ideation. This sort of gopiibhava, the ideation of a gopii, may be attained as the result of spiritual practices and merit from the performance of virtuous deeds for lives together. While imbibing this ideation of a gopii bit by bit as the result of prolonged meditation and merit, one can gradually elevate oneself to the highest state of devotion. It may also happen that within a very short period, even within an hour or two, this gopiibh치va may be aroused as the result of exclusive absorption in Parama Puru콑a. So one can become a gopii as a result of prolonged practice, or even within a very short period. This ideation is never confined within the limits of time. When a person moves towards Parama Puru콑a with tender ideation, full of smoothness, full of sweet peace, he or she is called a gopii.\n\u003e \n\u003e  On the Colour Festival, A Few Problems Solved Part 5\n\n#### Krsna Warrior\n\nThe nature of the warrior of Dharma Yuddha [War to establish a society founded upon spiritual righteousness] is so inspirationally revealed below:\n\n\u003e Kr콑켻a wanted to arouse a strong urge in people뗩 minds to fight against evil forces. Although Kr콑켻a did not provide any socio-economic-political theory, He made people conscious in the social, economic and cultural spheres, and advanced society by providing inspiration in His own unique way. That is, P치rthas치rathi Kr콑켻a helped the people to advance by expanding their social consciousness. That is why those who had received schooling from P치rthas치rathi jumped to the stage of s치r콑t패hi right from the lowermost stage of s치lokya. They did not rise gradually to successively higher stages through joy and sweet blissful experiences, but advanced to the highest stage all at once. But this sudden expansion involved labour, toil and struggle. It entailed great risk and demanded uncompromising fighting spirit  \n\u003e In the case of Arjuna, in the initial stages there were soft murmurings, but in the final stage there was the ear-shattering noise of P치incajanya [the name of Kr콑켻a뗩 conch for commencing battle] resulting in Arjuna뗩 final, supreme realization. However, things were different with Vraja Kr콑켻a [Krsna as the Lord of devotion]. His flute produced different notes at different times. When devotees achieve some spiritual progress through madhura bh치va, they hear a sound similar to a cricket sound. If you meditate in a lonely place with deep concentration you will hear the sound of crickets. Of course the crickets become silent after a while, whereas the Cosmic sound never stops its continuous refrain. This is the first stage of the flute sound of Vraja Kr콑켻a.  \n\u003e There are other sounds at other stages such as the roaring of seas, the rumbling of clouds and, finally, at the stage of s치r콑t패hi, the pluta [full] sound of the On拷쯞치ra [the Cosmic Sound], continuing its eternal flow without any break or pause. But while hearing the sound of the On拷쯞치ra, s치dhakas hear within it the sound of the flute. With their physical ears they hear it. When a s치dhaka attains this stage, he or she attains s치r콑t패hi, and feels, Lord! You exist. I exist. We are so close that I have become You. You have become me. One can attain s치r콑t패hi through P치rthas치rathi [Krsna as the fighter for justice] no doubt, but not of this kind. There the ideation is O Parama Puru콑a, O Lord, O P치rthas치rathi! You have made me exclusively Your own. My separate existence cannot be kept intact. I am a mere tool in Your hands. I will aim my arrow as You want me to. I am ready for all kinds of work.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Discourse 3, Nam치mi Kr콑켻asundaram\n\nShrii Sarkar has revealed that one prime duty of the Sadvipra is fighting and subduing dogmas in the society. While market fundamentalism (capitalism) and utopian totalitarianism (communism) are full of dogma, the real poisoners of society with dogmas are religions. How Sadvipras fight them is explained in the sterling words below.\n\n\u003e The dogmatic-minded people, the traditional people, are neither human beings nor animals. They do not listen to reason. They are to be struck, and those who do the striking are Sadvipras. The striking is to be done with a hammer! They are to be hit not with a hammer, but with a sledge hammer.  \n\u003e Suppose the Sadvipras do not hammer the dogmatic-minded people, what will happen? Because of their unnecessary presence the speed of others is retarded. The stagnant people commit suicide and become the cause of death for others.  \n\u003e Sadvipras will not leave or forgive such people, but will set them right with an iron hand. Dogmatic-minded people cannot be checked by the sanguine eyes of the so-called intellectuals or by the arms of the military. Humanity wants to move ahead, but the stagnant people who are neither human beings nor animals have blocked the way of the Sadvipras and have obstructed their movement. The common mass will not tolerate these obstructions.  \n\u003e This suicide is not deliberately done by the people. Those who commit suicide, do it when their mind is in a negative state. It is unnatural. Therefore, Sadvipras will remove this unnaturalness with the blows of their hammers. None can check it.  \n\u003e The duty of the Sadvipras will be to hammer these stagnant people who are a burden to society, who suffer from inertness in their physico-psychic sphere, at the appropriate moment so that the path of human progress becomes straight, clear and well-constructed.  \n\u003e When will the three causes of sin [poverty, excess wealth and static minds] be removed? Only when the Sadvipras will be ready to fight against them with an iron hand. Today, at this hour, it is my call to the Sadvipras of the world not to delay any longer. They should march ahead and save human ity and make the path of humanity free of thorns.T\n\u003e \n\u003e  hree Causes of Sin, A Few Problems Solved Part 6\n\nTo fight against overwhelming odds and triumph as a deva must requires perfection or Siddhi in the Principle of Tapah (austerities for the welfare of humanity).\n\n\u003e Tapah Siddhi is an impossibility without the six factors of Bhati [spiritual Preceptor, spiritual (not religious) practice, scripture, spiritual philosophy of life, universal social outlook, socio-economic paradigm to end exploitation. Those who strictly adhere to the principles of morality, are ensconced in Tapah, and are ready to wage a war against immoralists are sadvipras. Only those Sadvipras are safe from destruction and extinction who can work for the welfare of the human society. Therefore, it becomes the prime duty of all people to make themselves and others Sadvipras. By Sadvipra it is not meant those who practice Mala-Jap [rosary] or Pr치켻치y치m. In Pr치켻치y치m also there are three stages  Puraka means to inhale; Kumbhaka which is to hold the breath and recak which to exhale. The Pr치켻치y치m of the Sadvipras will be to inhale the entire universe in Purak, to keep it within in Kumbhaka and then to exhale it after mixing it with their own greatness and good will in Recaka.  \n\u003e Sadvipras will wage a ceaseless struggle against immorality and all sorts of fissiparous tendencies. Those who pose as Dharmic but are bashful with the spirit of fight cannot be called Sadvipras. Shiva was great because his Trishula [trident] was always ready to strike at the immoralists. Krishna was great because his arrows were meant to curb the anti-human and immoral elements. He also encouraged the moralists to wage war against the immoral ists. They were not only Sadvipras but also the parents of Sadvipras  the great Sadvipras  \n\u003e By making a useless fuss over problems one will not ease the trouble. The spirit to fight against all odds alone can solve the problems confronting human beings. March ahead and wage war against all difficulties, every impediment. Victory is sure to embrace you. Difficulties and encumbrances cannot be more powerful than your capacity to solve them. You are the children of the great Cosmic Entity. Be a Sadvipra and make others Sadvipras also.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Future of Civilization\n\nIt is not only the dogmatic people who require a hammering it is the animalistic persons who bully and dominate society today.\n\n\u003e There is movement in all three spheres of life  physical, mental and spiritual.  \n\u003e Movement in the physical realm means the construction of the sadvipra society. [Sadvipra: a spiritual revolutionary.] The society is filled with pitchers of p치pa [vice, sin] today. Break these pitchers to pieces with a stroke of your feet. [This is your destiny.] P치pa will oppose you, but you will have to face the challenge. One who annihilates physical p치pa is a sadvipra. This is your dharma in the mundane world. You are human beings, because you are fighting against the immoralists.  \n\u003e In the psychic realm you have to establish righteousness by removing the germs of crude mentality. Everywhere in the world today the crude intellect dominates. It is your duty to replace it with your righteous intellect.  \n\u003e Once I was travelling by car in Bihar. The driver had to stop the car several times to remove the dogs from the street. When a s치dhaka who was sitting beside me asked why the dogs did not heed the horn of the car, I replied that the dogs could not hear, for this was the kingdom of the dogs, the rule of the dogs.  \n\u003e This is the condition that prevails throughout the world today. Crude animal intellect is reigning supreme throughout the world. You have to remove it. It is natural that it would not hear your call, it would not like to move from its position. Under these circumstances, you will have to remove the predominance of animal intellect even by the use of force. I do not want [animals] in the form of human beings to remain on this earth even for a second. This is a world of humans, and not of animals. Therefore, do not relax even for a fraction of a second.  \n\u003e In the spiritual realm, your task is to establish Cosmic Ideation. Marching ahead is life. Those who malinger and shirk the responsibility of moving ahead should be thrown in the cremation ground. If the body becomes old by moving, let it be changed. It is not proper to wear old and dirty clothes. If the body decays in the process of moving ahead, change it for another one, and go on performing good actions.  \n\u003e I want you to work with this body only, and then leave it permanently. This is not impossible for you. Increase the speed of your activities thousands of times or even countless times more than what it is now, and accomplish your work with this body only.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Accomplish Your Work with This Body Only, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 23\n\nHowever despite this harshness to the arrogant exploiters, Sadvipras are full of softness for the so-called wretched people scorned by society. As Shrii Sarkar explains in these noble words:\n\n\u003e It was mentioned earlier that human value means nothing but to treat the joys and sorrows, hopes and aspirations of human beings sympathetically, and see them merged in Cosmic Consciousness and established in divine majesty. And if one is to elevate oneself to that sublime height, he or she will have to be supplied with an environment suitable to his or her physical, mental and spiritual existence. It is the birthright of everyone to make headway in their trifarious existence. It is the duty of society to accord recognition to this human right. Society has failed to do its duty, and that is why life is full of sorrow and suffering.  \n\u003e No one can say for certain that no great person might have emerged from among those wayward urchins whom we are wont to slight and hate. Women who have turned to prostitution for the sake of their physical existence might have grown into noble personalities if their agony had been appreciated sympathetically, and if they had been rehabilitated by society. But since society has nothing to do with human value, a good number of great personalities are withering away in their embryonic stage. The sadvipras will undertake to revive this neglected section of humanity. To them no sinner is contemptible, no one is a rogue. People turn into satans or sinners when, for want of proper guidance, they are goaded by depraving propensities. The human mind goaded by depraving propensities is satan. If their propensities are sublimated, they will no longer be satans; they will be transformed into gods. Every course of action of society ought to be judged with an eye to the dictum Human beings are divine children.렢n\u003e \n\u003e -The Neohumanism of Sadvipras, Neohumanism in a Nutshell\n\nShrii Sarkar reveals how Sadvipras will fill the society with universalism and courage saying,\n\n\u003e Only to those who aspire to realize Parama Puru콑a [Supreme Consciousness] and are free from selfishness may be entrusted the guardianship of society. Only those who are established in Yama and Niyama and who have accepted Brahma [the Supreme Entity] as the goal of their life are capable of safeguarding the interests of the human race. Such people alone are sadvipras and only they can represent humanity  they alone can serve all creation selflessly. Sadvipras will be identified by their conduct, their commitment to service, their dutifulness and their strength of character. Only they will firmly proclaim, ㄹll human beings belong to one race! All have equal rights! All are members of the same human family! Only these sadvipras can warn the exploiters in a thunderous voice: No exploitation of one person by another! No exploitation in the name of religion! Such sadvipras will become the guardians of society. Sadvipras will never stop the ongoing class struggle which manifests according to the laws of the sam치ja cakra [social cycle]. They will only ensure that the rulers do not exploit society; thus they will rule the rulers.\n\u003e \n\u003e  Social Defects in Gandhism\n\nNow what is the primary duty of the Sadvipra  it lies in controlling the Social Cycle. As per the spiritual vision of history and sociology given by Shrii Sarkar, human history is the history of the collective psychology of a civilization.\n\nWhen the collective psychology is dominated by the urge for K치ma or material pleasure then it becomes dominated by matter and is known as Shudra Society. When the society is dominated by the urge for Dharma or noble righteousness then the society is known as Ksattriya [martial] Society. When the society is dominated by the urge for Para [higher] Artha (meaning, intellectual knowledge) then it is known as Vipra Society usually controlled by priests. When the society is dominated by the urge for Apara [lower] Artha or wealth and prosperity, then it is known as Vaeshya [Capitalist] Society. The extreme exploitation of the capitalists impoverishes the entire society, driving to revolt then there occurs a Shudra [worker] Revolution. Since the Shudras are unable to hold power for long, the warriors (ksattriyas) seize power and then the social cycle begins anew.\n\nAs we have seen in the first quote of Sadvipra in this article, the Sadvipra remains at the nucleus of the cycle. The Sadvipra does not allow society to suffer repeatedly when the Martial, Intellectual and Capitalist rulers become corrupted and then exploitative. Instead the Sadvipra rouses the common people to revolution and brings the next age into being. The Sadvipra does not seize power but rather remains as the watchguard. Only when the rulers of a society become exploitative do Sadvipras launch a nuclear revolution. As omni-dimensional personalities, Sadvipras are capable of martial, intellectual and economic warfare.  \nThe Sadvipra accomplishes this as we have seen by creating powerful waves in the collective psychology. As Shrii Sarkar explains\n\n\u003e If the resultant cumulative flow of innumerable individuals is termed the social or collective flow, then the latter뗩 trough and crest is shorter than the trough and crest of the individual flows. And this shortness of the collective wavelength hastens either a kr치nti [evolution] or a viplava [revolution].\n\u003e \n\u003e  The K콑atriya Age, Human Society II\n\nWhat does this mean? When an individual or a group of individuals (such as Hari Parima켻d패ala Go콑t패i) creates tremendous waves in their minds due to intensely loving and longing kiirtana then this can create a revolution in society. Such mental tidalwaves are called the Tandava Dance.\n\n\u003e Parama Puru콑a seated in the middle of this cosmological order is merely smiling to see that His vast and mysterious universe of animate and inanimate creatures is moving around Him as the Nucleus. Here the living world does not only include human beings, it also includes birds, animals, reptiles, trees and plants. I have described this endless movement of microcosms around the nucleus as an eternal dance around the Supreme. I call it a dance because this movement of the microcosms is also proceeding in a rhythmic vibration, alternately rising and falling. Thus it is not an ordinary movement  it is a veritable dance. When the waves are gigantic, the dance becomes unnatural: in that case we can call it the ta켻d패ava dance.\n\u003e \n\u003e  The Hub of Universal Activities, Subh치콑ita Sa拷쯚raha Part 11\n\nThus the entire society becomes dominated by this Tantric dynamism of Tandava. This will cause more and more people to become Sadvipras as Shrii Sarkar explains:\n\n\u003e With the smooth, natural and progressive channelisation of the psychic urges of the individual and collective mind towards the Supreme Entity, psychic pabula will be converted into psycho-spiritual pabulum. Then each person will be a Sadvipra, and the whole society will be a Sadvipra Sam치j  an 츼nanda Pariv치ra. So the transformation of psychic pabula into psycho-spiritual pabulum is the only panacea.\n\u003e \n\u003e  The Transformation of Psychic Pabula into Psycho-spiritual Pabulum, A Few Problems Solved Part 8\n\nThis is why Shrii Sarkar calls upon us all saying,\n\n\u003e A yuga parivarttana [change in age] is taking place. All of you plunge wholeheartedly into making sadvipra sam치ja [spiritual society]. Do not be indecisive, do not hesitate, and do not under any circumstances feel fear. Your victory is a certainty.\n\u003e \n\u003e  The Purpose Behind the Advent, 츼nanda Vacan치mrtam Part 1\n\nLet us then close with the song of the Sadvipra we are bound to sing and bound to embody in our lives.\n\n\u003e _**Prabhat Samgiita 4871 (01/06/1990)**_\n\u003e \n\u003e EI, P츼PER NIGA콊 DURNIITI GA콊H,  \n\u003e BHEUNGE PHELO KARO C칔R,  \n\u003e ESO BH츼I ESO PR츼켺A KHULE MESHO,  \n\u003e 츼R TH츼KIO N츼 D칔R,  \n\u003e BHEUNGE PHELO KARO C칔R\n\u003e \n\u003e D츼NAVA KARECHE SH츼SAN SHO콐A켺,  \n\u003e 츼츼  \n\u003e D츼NAVA KARECHE SH츼SAN SHO콐A켺,  \n\u003e KARI츼 CALECHE SVAJAN PO콐A켺A  \n\u003e DU콐TA PEYECHE AB츼DHA TO콐A켺,  \n\u003e NIRIIHA HOLO 츼T칔R,  \n\u003e BHEUNGE PHELO KARO C칔R,\n\u003e \n\u003e EI, P츼PER NIGA콊 DURNIITI GA콊H,  \n\u003e BHEUNGE PHELO KARO C칔R,\n\u003e \n\u003e P칔RVA 츼K츼SHE DEKHO R츼UNG츼 RAVI,  \n\u003e 츼츼  \n\u003e P칔RVA 츼K츼SHE DEKHO R츼UNG츼 RAVI,  \n\u003e MUCHE PHELO JAM츼 JATA K츼LI SABAI,  \n\u003e DEKHO JENO RAVI N츼HI J츼Y D패UBI,  \n\u003e N츼 츼SE 츼NDH츼R ASUR  \n\u003e BHEUNGE PHELO KARO C칔R,\n\u003e \n\u003e EI, P츼PER NIGA콊 DURNIITI GA콊H,  \n\u003e BHEUNGE PHELO KARO C칔R\n\n_These shackles of vice,  \nThis fortress of corruption  \nBreak free and pulverize them._\n\n_Come brothers and sisters,  \nCome with an open heart,  \nMerging with everyone.  \nDo not stay away anymore.  \nBreak free and pulverize them._\n\n_Demons are tyranizing and exploiting,  \nGuarding and nourishing their gangsters.  \nThe vicious and the depraved revel in joy,  \nWhile the helpless poor are frantic.  \nBreak free and pulverize them._\n\n_O look at the colourful sun  \nIn the eastern skies.  \nWipe out all the piled-up darkness;  \nSee to it that the sun doesn뗪 sink.  \nAnd that demons do not prowl in the dark.  \nBreak free and pulverize them._\n\n Shrii Prabhat Ranjan Sarkar","lastmodified":"2023-05-22T03:06:06.349499394Z","tags":["sadvipra"]},"/notes/images/Untitled":{"title":"Untitled","content":"# sa","lastmodified":"2023-05-22T03:06:06.349499394Z","tags":[]}}
